<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> leave Saving to the private investor, and we
encourage him to place his savings mainly in titles
to money. We leave the responsibility for setting
Production in motion to the business man, who is
mainly influenced by the profits which he expects to
accrue to himself in terms of money. Those who
are not in favour of drastic changes in the existing
organisation of society believe that these arrangements,
being in accord with human nature, have
great advantages. But they cannot work properly if
the money, which they assume as a stable measuring-rod,
is undependable. Unemployment, the precarious
life of the worker, the disappointment of expectation,
the sudden loss of savings, the excessive windfalls
to individuals, the speculator, the profiteer—all proceed,
in large measure, from the instability of the
standard of value.</p>

<p>It is often supposed that the costs of production
are threefold, corresponding to the rewards of labour,
enterprise, and accumulation. But there is a fourth
cost, namely risk; and the reward of risk-bearing is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
one of the heaviest, and perhaps the most avoidable,
burden on production. This element of risk is greatly
aggravated by the instability of the standard of value.
Currency Reforms, which led to the adoption by this
country and the world at large of sound monetary
principles, would diminish the wastes of <em>Risk</em>, which
consume at present too much of our estate.</p>

<p>Nowhere do conservative notions consider themselves
more in place than in currency; yet nowhere
is the need of innovation more urgent. One is
often warned that a scientific treatment of currency
questions is impossible because the banking world
is intellectually incapable of understanding its own
problems. If this is true, the order of Society,
which they stand for, will decay. But I do not
believe it. What we have lacked is a clear analysis
of the real facts, rather than ability to understand
an analysis already given. If the new ideas, now
developing in many quarters, are sound and right, I
do not doubt that sooner or later they will prevail.
I dedicate this book, humbly and without permission,
to the Governors and Court of the Bank of England,
who now and for the future have a much more
difficult and anxious task entrusted to them than in
former days.</p>

in its operation and affects all transactions equally,
has no consequences. If, by a change in the established
standard of value, a man received and owned
twice as much money as he did before in payment
for all rights and for all efforts, and if he also paid
out twice as much money for all acquisitions and
for all satisfactions, he would be wholly unaffected.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that a change in the value
of money, that is to say in the level of prices, is
important to Society only in so far as its incidence
is unequal. Such changes have produced in the
past, and are producing now, the vastest social consequences,
because, as we all know, when the value
of money changes, it does <em>not</em> change equally for all
persons or for all purposes. A man’s receipts and
his outgoings are not all modified in one uniform
proportion. Thus a change in prices and rewards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
as measured in money, generally affects different
classes unequally, transfers wealth from one to
another, bestows affluence here and embarrassment
there, and redistributes Fortune’s favours so as to
frustrate design and disappoint expectation.</p>

<p>The fluctuations in the value of money since 1914
have been on a scale so great as to constitute, with
all that they involve, one of the most significant
events in the economic history of the modern world.
The fluctuation of the standard, whether gold,
silver, or paper, has not only been of unprecedented
violence, but has been visited on a society of which
the economic organisation is more dependent than
that of any earlier epoch on the assumption that the
standard of value would be moderately stable.</p>

<p>During the Napoleonic Wars and the period immediately
succeeding them the extreme fluctuation
of English prices within a single year was 22 per cent;
and the highest price level reached during the first
quarter of the nineteenth century, which we used to
reckon the most disturbed period of our currency
history, was less than double the lowest and with
an interval of thirteen years. Compare with this
the extraordinary movements of the past nine
years. To recall the reader’s mind to the exact
facts, I refer him to the table on the next page.</p>

<p>I have not included those countries—Russia,
Poland, and Austria—where the old currency has
long been bankrupt. But it will be observed that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
even apart from the countries which have suffered
revolution or defeat, no quarter of the world has
escaped a violent movement. In the United States,
where the gold standard has functioned unabated,
in Japan, where the war brought with it more profit
than liability, in the neutral country of Sweden, the
changes in the value of money have been comparable
with those in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>From 1914 to 1920 all these countries experienced
an expansion in the supply of money to spend relatively
to the supply of things to purchase, that is to
say <em>Inflation</em>. Since 1920 those countries which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
regained control of their financial situation, not
content with bringing the Inflation to an end, have
contracted their supply of money and have experienced
the fruits of <em>Deflation</em>. Others have followed inflationary
courses more riotously than before. In a
few, of which Italy is one, an imprudent desire to
deflate has been balanced by the intractability of
the financial situation, with the happy result of
comparatively stable prices.</p>

<p>Each process, Inflation and Deflation alike, has
inflicted great injuries. Each has an effect in altering
the <em>distribution</em> of wealth between different classes,
Inflation in this respect being the worse of the two.
Each has also an effect in overstimulating or retarding
the <em>production</em> of wealth, though here Deflation is
the more injurious. The division of our subject thus
indicated is the most convenient for us to follow,—examining
first the effect of changes in the value of
money on the distribution of wealth with most of our
attention on Inflation, and next their effect on the
production of wealth with most of our attention on
Deflation. How have the price changes of the past
nine years affected the productivity of the community
as a whole, and how have they affected the conflicting
interests and mutual relations of its component
classes? The answer to these questions will serve to
establish the gravity of the evils, into the remedy for
which it is the object of this book to inquire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_1">I.—<span class="smcap">Changes in the Value of Money,
as affecting Distribution</span></h3>

<p>For the purpose of this inquiry a triple classification
of Society is convenient—into the Investing Class, the
Business Class, and the Earning Class. These classes
overlap, and the same individual may earn, deal, and
invest; but in the present organisation of society such
a division corresponds to a social cleavage and an
actual divergence of interest.</p>

<h4 id="sec_2">1. <i>The Investing Class.</i></h4>

<p>Of the various purposes which money serves, some
essentially depend upon the assumption that its
real value is nearly constant over a period of time.
The chief of these are those connected, in a wide
sense, with contracts for the <em>investment of money</em>.
Such contracts—namely, those which provide for the
payment of fixed sums of money over a long period
of time—are the characteristic of what it is convenient
to call the <em>Investment System</em>, as distinct from the
property system generally.</p>

<p>Under this phase of capitalism, as developed
during the nineteenth century, many arrangements
were devised for separating the management of
property from its ownership. These arrangements
were of three leading types: (1) Those in which
the proprietor, while parting with the management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of his property, retained his ownership of it—<i>i.e.</i> of
the actual land, buildings, and machinery, or of whatever
else it consisted in, this mode of tenure being
typified by a holding of ordinary shares in a joint-stock
company; (2) those in which he parted with
the property temporarily, receiving a fixed sum of
<em>money</em> annually in the meantime, but regained his
property eventually, as typified by a lease; and (3)
those in which he parted with his real property
permanently, in return either for a perpetual annuity
fixed in terms of money, or for a terminable annuity
and the repayment of the principal in money at
the end of the term, as typified by mortgages,
bonds, debentures, and preference shares. This
third type represents the full development of
<em>Investment</em>.</p>

<p>Contracts to receive fixed sums of money at future
dates (made without provision for possible changes
in the real value of money at those dates) must
have existed as long as money has been lent and
borrowed. In the form of leases and mortgages, and
also of permanent loans to Governments and to a
few private bodies, such as the East India Company,
they were already frequent in the eighteenth century.
But during the nineteenth century they
developed a new and increased importance, and had,
by the beginning of the twentieth, divided the
propertied classes into two groups—the “business
men” and the “investors”—with partly divergent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
interests. The division was not sharp as between
individuals; for business men might be investors
also, and investors might hold ordinary shares;
but the division was nevertheless real, and not the
less important because it was seldom noticed.</p>

<p>By this system the active business class could
call to the aid of their enterprises not only their own
wealth but the savings of the whole community;
and the professional and propertied classes, on the
other hand, could find an employment for their
resources, which involved them in little trouble, no
responsibility, and (it was believed) small risk.</p>

<p>For a hundred years the system worked, throughout
Europe, with an extraordinary success and facilitated
the growth of wealth on an unprecedented scale. To
save and to invest became at once the duty and the
delight of a large class. The savings were seldom
drawn on, and, accumulating at compound interest,
made possible the material triumphs which we now all
take for granted. The morals, the politics, the literature,
and the religion of the age joined in a grand
conspiracy for the promotion of saving. God and
Mammon were reconciled. Peace on earth to men
of good means. A rich man could, after all, enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven—if only he saved.
A new harmony sounded from the celestial spheres.
“It is curious to observe how, through the wise and
beneficent arrangement of Providence, men thus do
the greatest service to the public, when they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
thinking of nothing but their own gain”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">1</a>; so sang
the angels.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">1</a> <cite>Easy Lessons on Money Matters for the Use of Young People.</cite> Published
by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Twelfth Edition, 1850.</p>

</div>

<p>The atmosphere thus created well harmonised
the demands of expanding business and the needs
of an expanding population with the growth of a
comfortable non-business class. But amidst the
general enjoyment of ease and progress, the extent,
to which the system depended on the stability of the
money to which the investing classes had committed
their fortunes, was generally overlooked; and an
unquestioning confidence was apparently felt that
this matter would look after itself. Investments
spread and multiplied, until, for the middle classes
of the world, the gilt-edged bond came to typify
all that was most permanent and most secure. So
rooted in our day has been the conventional belief
in the stability and safety of a money contract that,
according to English law, trustees have been
encouraged to embark their trust funds exclusively
in such transactions, and are indeed forbidden,
except in the case of real estate (an exception which
is itself a survival of the conditions of an earlier
age), to employ them otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">2</a> German trustees were not released from a similar obligation until 1923,
by which date the value of trust funds invested in titles to money had
entirely disappeared.</p>

</div>

<p>As in other respects, so also in this, the nineteenth
century relied on the future permanence of its own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
happy experiences and disregarded the warning of
past misfortunes. It chose to forget that there is no
historical warrant for expecting money to be represented
even by a constant quantity of a particular
metal, far less by a constant purchasing power. Yet
Money is simply that which the State declares from
time to time to be a good legal discharge of money
contracts. In 1914 gold had not been the English
standard for a century or the sole standard of any
other country for half a century. There is no record
of a prolonged war or a great social upheaval which
has not been accompanied by a change in the legal
tender, but an almost unbroken chronicle in every
country which has a history, back to the earliest
dawn of economic record, of a progressive deterioration
in the real value of the successive legal tenders
which have represented money.</p>

<p>Moreover, this progressive deterioration in the
value of money through history is not an accident,
and has had behind it two great driving forces—the
impecuniosity of Governments and the superior
political influence of the debtor class.</p>

<p>The power of taxation by currency depreciation
is one which has been inherent in the State since
Rome discovered it. The creation of legal-tender
has been and is a Government’s ultimate reserve;
and no State or Government is likely to decree its
own bankruptcy or its own downfall, so long as this
instrument still lies at hand unused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>Besides this, as we shall see below, the benefits
of a depreciating currency are not restricted to
the Government. Farmers and debtors and all
persons liable to pay fixed money dues share in
the advantage. As now in the persons of business
men, so also in former ages these classes constituted
the active and constructive elements in the economic
scheme. Those secular changes, therefore, which in
the past have depreciated money, assisted the new
men and emancipated them from the dead hand; they
benefited new wealth at the expense of old, and armed
enterprise against accumulation. The tendency of
money to depreciate has been in past times a weighty
counterpoise against the cumulative results of compound
interest and the inheritance of fortunes. It
has been a loosening influence against the rigid
distribution of old-won wealth and the separation
of ownership from activity. By this means each
generation can disinherit in part its predecessors’
heirs; and the project of founding a perpetual
fortune must be disappointed in this way, unless
the community with conscious deliberation provides
against it in some other way, more equitable and
more expedient.</p>

<p>At any rate, under the influence of these two
forces—the financial necessities of Governments and
the political influence of the debtor class—sometimes
the one and sometimes the other, the progress of
inflation has been <em>continuous</em>, if we consider long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
periods, ever since money was first devised in the
sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Sometimes the standard of value
has depreciated of itself; failing this, debasements
have done the work.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is easy at all times, as a result of
the way we use money in daily life, to forget all this
and to look on money as itself the absolute standard
of value; and when, besides, the actual events of a
hundred years have not disturbed his illusions, the
average man regards what has been normal for
three generations as a part of the permanent social
fabric.</p>

<p>The course of events during the nineteenth century
favoured such ideas. During its first quarter, the
very high prices of the Napoleonic Wars were followed
by a somewhat rapid improvement in the value of
money. For the next seventy years, with some
temporary fluctuations, the tendency of prices continued
to be downwards, the lowest point being
reached in 1896. But while this was the tendency
as regards direction, the remarkable feature of this
long period was the relative <em>stability</em> of the price
level. Approximately the <em>same</em> level of price ruled
in or about the years 1826, 1841, 1855, 1862, 1867,
1871, and 1915. Prices were also level in the years
1844, 1881, and 1914. If we call the index number
of these latter years 100, we find that, for the period
of close on a century from 1826 to the outbreak of
war, the maximum fluctuation in either direction was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
30 points, the index number never rising above 130
and never falling below 70. No wonder that we came
to believe in the stability of money contracts over
a long period. The metal <em>gold</em> might not possess
all the theoretical advantages of an artificially regulated
standard, but it could not be tampered with and
had proved reliable in practice.</p>

<p>At the same time, the investor in Consols in the
early part of the century had done very well in three
different ways. The “security” of his investment
had come to be considered as near absolute perfection
as was possible. Its capital value had uniformly
appreciated, partly for the reason just stated, but
chiefly because the steady fall in the rate of interest
increased the number of years’ purchase of the annual
income which represented the capital.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">3</a> And the
annual money income had a purchasing power which
on the whole was increasing. If, for example, we
consider the seventy years from 1826 to 1896 (and
ignore the great improvement immediately after
Waterloo), we find that the capital value of Consols
rose steadily, with only temporary set-backs, from
79 to 109 (in spite of Goschen’s conversion from
a 3 per cent rate to a 2¾ per cent rate in 1889 and
a 2½ per cent rate effective in 1903), while the purchasing
power of the annual dividends, even after allowing
for the reduced rates of interest, had increased 50 per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
cent. But Consols, too, had added the virtue of
stability to that of improvement. Except in years of
crisis Consols never fell below 90 during the reign of
Queen Victoria; and even in ’48, when thrones were
crumbling, the mean price of the year fell but 5 points.
Ninety when she ascended the throne, they reached
their maximum with her in the year of Diamond
Jubilee. What wonder that our parents thought
Consols a good investment!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">3</a> If (for example) the rate of interest falls from 4½ per cent to 3 per
cent, 3 per cent Consols rise in value from 66 to 100.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus there grew up during the nineteenth century
a large, powerful, and greatly respected class of
persons, well-to-do individually and very wealthy
in the aggregate, who owned neither buildings,
nor land, nor businesses, nor precious metals, but
titles to an annual income in legal-tender money.
In particular, that peculiar creation and pride
of the nineteenth century, the savings of the
middle class, had been mainly thus embarked.
Custom and favourable experience had acquired
for such investments an unimpeachable reputation
for security.</p>

<p>Before the war these medium fortunes had
already begun to suffer some loss (as compared
with the summit of their prosperity in the middle
’nineties) from the rise in prices and also in the
rate of interest. But the monetary events which
have accompanied and have followed the war have
taken from them about one-half of their real value
in England, seven-eighths in France, eleven-twelfths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
in Italy, and virtually the whole in Germany and
in the succession states of Austria-Hungary and
Russia.</p>

<p>The loss to the typical English investor of the
pre-war period is sufficiently measured by the loss
to the investor in Consols. Such an investor, as
we have already seen, was steadily improving his
position, apart from temporary fluctuations, up
to 1896, and in this and the following year two
maxima were reached simultaneously—both the
capital value of an annuity and also the purchasing
power of money. Between 1896 and 1914, on the
other hand, the investor had already suffered a serious
loss—the capital value of his annuity had fallen by
about a third, and the purchasing power of his income
had also fallen by nearly a third. This loss, however,
was incurred gradually over a period of nearly
twenty years from an exceptional maximum, and
did not leave him appreciably worse off than he had
been in the early ’eighties or the early ’forties. But
upon the top of this came the further swifter loss of
the war period. Between 1914 and 1920 the capital
value of the investor’s annuity again fell by more
than a third, and the purchasing power of his income
by about two-thirds. In addition, the standard rate
of income tax rose from 7½ per cent in 1914 to
30 per cent in 1921.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">4</a> Roughly estimated in round
numbers, the change may be represented thus in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
terms of an index of which the base year is

<p>The second column well illustrates what a splendid
investment gilt-edged stocks had been through
the century from Waterloo to Mons, even if we omit
altogether the abnormal values of 1896–97. Our
table shows how the epoch of Diamond Jubilee was
the culminating moment in the prosperity of the
British middle class. But it also exhibits with the
precision of figures the familiar bewailed plight of
those who try to live on the income of the same
trustee investments as before the war. The owner
of consols in 1922 had a real income, one half of
what he had in 1914 and one third of what he had
in 1896. The whole of the improvement of the
nineteenth century had been obliterated, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
situation was not quite so good as it had been after
Waterloo.</p>

<p>Some mitigating circumstances should not be overlooked.
Whilst the war was a period of the dissipation
of the community’s resources as a whole, it was
a period of saving for the individuals of the saving
class, who with their larger holdings of the securities
of the Government now have an increased aggregate
money claim on the receipts of the Exchequer. Also,
the investing class, which has lost money, overlaps,
both socially and by the ties of family, with the
business class, which has made money, sufficiently to
break in many cases the full severity of the loss.
Moreover, in England, there has been a substantial
recovery from the low point of 1920.</p>

<p>But these things do not wash away the significance
of the facts. The effect of the war, and of the monetary
policy which has accompanied and followed it,
has been to take away a large part of the real value
of the possessions of the investing class. The loss
has been so rapid and so intermixed in the time of its
occurrence with other worse losses that its full measure
is not yet separately apprehended. But it has
effected, nevertheless, a far-reaching change in the
relative position of different classes. Throughout the
Continent the pre-war savings of the middle class, so
far as they were invested in bonds, mortgages, or bank
deposits, have been largely or entirely wiped out.
Nor can it be doubted that this experience must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
modify social psychology towards the practice of
saving and investment. What was deemed most
secure has proved least so. He who neither spent
nor “speculated,” who made “proper provision for
his family,” who sang hymns to security and observed
most straitly the morals of the edified and the
respectable injunctions of the worldly-wise,—he,
indeed, who gave fewest pledges to Fortune has yet
suffered her heaviest visitations.</p>

<p>What moral for our present purpose should we
draw from this? Chiefly, I think, that it is not safe
or fair to combine the social organisation developed
during the nineteenth century (and still retained)
with a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laisser-faire</i> policy towards the value of money.
It is not true that our former arrangements have
worked well. If we are to continue to draw the
voluntary savings of the community into “investments,”
we must make it a prime object of deliberate
State policy that the standard of value, in terms of
which they are expressed, should be kept stable;
adjusting in other ways (calculated to touch all forms
of wealth equally and not concentrated on the
relatively helpless “investors”) the redistribution
of the national wealth, if, in course of time, the laws
of inheritance and the rate of accumulation have
drained too great a proportion of the income of
the active classes into the spending control of the
inactive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<h4 id="sec_3">2. <i>The Business Class.</i></h4>

<p>It has long been recognised, by the business world
and by economists alike, that a period of rising prices
acts as a stimulus to enterprise and is beneficial to
business men.</p>

<p>In the first place there is the advantage which is
the counterpart of the loss to the investing class which
we have just examined. When the value of money
falls, it is evident that those persons who have engaged
to pay fixed sums of money yearly out of the profits
of active business must benefit, since their fixed money
outgoings will bear a smaller proportion than formerly
to their money turnover. This benefit persists not
only during the transitional period of change, but
also, so far as old loans are concerned, when prices
have settled down at their new and higher level.
For example, the farmers throughout Europe, who
had raised by mortgage the funds to purchase the
land they farmed, now find themselves almost freed
from the burden at the expense of the mortgagees.</p>

<p>But during the period of change, while prices are
rising month by month, the business man has a
further and greater source of windfall. Whether he
is a merchant or a manufacturer, he will generally
buy before he sells, and on at least a part of his stock
he will run the risk of price changes. If, therefore,
month after month his stock appreciates on his
hands, he is always selling at a better price than he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
expected and securing a windfall profit upon which
he had not calculated. In such a period the business
of trade becomes unduly easy. Any one who can
borrow money and is not exceptionally unlucky must
make a profit, which he may have done little to
deserve. The continuous enjoyment of such profits
engenders an expectation of their renewal. The
practice of borrowing from banks is extended beyond
what is normal. If the market expects prices to rise
still further, it is natural that stocks of commodities
should be held speculatively for the rise, and for a
time the mere expectation of a rise is sufficient, by
inducing speculative purchases, to produce one.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the <cite>Statist</cite> index number for
raw materials month by month from April, 1919,
to March, 1920:</p>

<p class="in0">It follows from this table that a man, who borrowed
money from his banker and used the proceeds to
purchase raw materials selected at random, stood to
make a profit in every single month of this period
with the exception of the last, and would have cleared
46 per cent on the average of the year. Yet bankers
were not charging at this time above 7 per cent
for their advances, leaving a clear profit of between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
30 and 40 per cent per annum, without the exercise
of any particular skill, to any person lucky enough
to have embarked on these courses. How much
more were the opportunities of persons whose business
position and expert knowledge enabled them to
exercise intelligent anticipation as to the probable
course of prices of particular commodities! Yet
any dealer in or user of raw materials on a large
scale who knew his trade was thus situated. The
profits of certain kinds of business to the man who
has a little skill or some luck are certain in such a
period to be inordinate. Great fortunes may be made
in a few months. But apart from all such, the steady-going
business man, who would be pained and insulted
at the thought of being designated speculator or
profiteer, may find windfall profits dropping into his
lap which he has neither sought nor desired.</p>

<p>Economists draw an instructive distinction between
what are termed the “money” rate of interest
and the “real” rate of interest. If a sum of money
worth 100 in terms of commodities at the time when
the loan is made is lent for a year at 5 per cent interest,
and is only worth 90 in terms of commodities at the
end of the year, the lender receives back, including his
interest, what is only worth 94½. This is expressed
by saying that while the <em>money</em> rate of interest was
5 per cent, the <em>real</em> rate of interest had actually been
negative and equal to <em>minus</em> 5½ per cent. In the
same way, if at the end of the period the value of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
money had risen and the capital sum lent had come
to be worth 110 in terms of commodities, while the
<em>money</em> rate of interest would still be 5 per cent the
<em>real</em> rate of interest would have been 15½ per cent.</p>

<p>Such considerations, even though they are not
explicitly present to the minds of the business world,
are far from being academic. The business world
may speak, and even think, as though the money
rate of interest could be considered by itself, without
reference to the real rate. But it does not act so.
The merchant or manufacturer, who is calculating
whether a 7 per cent bank rate is so onerous as to
compel him to curtail his operations, is very much
influenced by his anticipations about the prospective
price of the commodity in which he is interested.</p>

<p>Thus, when prices are rising, the business man
who borrows money is able to repay the lender with
what, in terms of real value, not only represents no
interest, but is even less than the capital originally
advanced; that is, the real rate of interest falls to
a negative value, and the borrower reaps a corresponding
benefit. It is true that, in so far as a rise
of prices is foreseen, attempts to get advantage from
this by increased borrowing force the money rates of
interest to move upwards. It is for this reason,
amongst others, that a high bank rate should be
associated with a period of rising prices, and a low
bank rate with a period of falling prices. The
apparent abnormality of the money rate of interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
at such times is merely the other side of the
attempt of the real rate of interest to steady itself.
Nevertheless in a period of rapidly changing prices,
the money rate of interest seldom adjusts itself
adequately or fast enough to prevent the real rate
from becoming abnormal. For it is not the <em>fact</em> of
a given rise of prices, but the <em>expectation</em> of a rise
compounded of the various possible price-movements
and the estimated probability of each, which affects
money rates; and in countries where the currency
has not collapsed completely, there has seldom or
never existed a sufficient general confidence in a
further rise or fall of prices to cause the short-money
rate of interest to rise above 10 per cent per annum,
or to fall below 1 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">6</a> A fluctuation of this
order is not sufficient to balance a movement of
prices, up or down, of more than (say) 5 per cent
per annum,—a rate which the actual price movement
has frequently exceeded.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">6</a> The merchant, who borrows money in order to take advantage of a
prospective high real rate of interest, has to act in advance of the rise in
prices, and is calculating on a probability, not upon a certainty, with the
result that he will be deterred by a movement in the money rate of interest
of much less magnitude than the contrary movement in the real rate of
interest, upon which indeed he is reckoning, yet is not reckoning with
certainty.</p>

</div>

<p>Germany has recently provided an illustration of
the extraordinary degree in which the money rate of
interest can rise in its endeavour to keep up with
the real rate, when prices have continued to rise for
so long and with such violence that, rightly or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
wrongly, every one believes that they will continue
to rise further. Yet even there the money rate of
interest has never risen high enough to keep pace
with the rise of prices. In the autumn of 1922,
the full effects were just becoming visible of the long
preceding period during which the real rate of interest
in Germany had reached a high negative figure, that
is to say during which any one who could borrow
marks and turn them into assets would have found
at the end of any given period that the appreciation
in the mark-value of the assets was far greater than
the interest he had to pay for borrowing them. By
this means great fortunes were snatched out of general
calamity; and those made most who had seen first,
that the right game was to borrow and to borrow
and to borrow, and thus secure the difference between
the real rate of interest and the money rate. But
after this had been good business for many months,
every one began to take a hand, with belated results
on the money rate of interest. At that time, with a
nominal Reichsbank rate of 8 per cent, the effective
gilt-edged rate for short loans had risen to 22 per cent
per annum. During the first half of 1923, the rate of
the Reichsbank itself rose to 24 per cent, and subsequently
to 30, and finally 108 per cent, whilst the
market rate fluctuated violently at preposterous
figures, reaching at times 3 per cent <em>per week</em> for
certain types of loan. With the final currency
collapse of July-September 1923, the open market<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
rate was altogether demoralised, and reached figures
of 100 per cent per month. In face, however, of the
rate of currency depreciation, even such figures were
inadequate, and the bold borrower was still making
money.</p>

<p>In Hungary, Poland, and Russia—wherever prices
were expected to collapse yet further—the same
phenomenon was present, exhibiting as through a
microscope what takes place everywhere when prices
are expected to rise.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when prices are falling 30 to
40 per cent between the average of one year and that
of the next, as they were in Great Britain and in
the United States during 1921, even a bank rate of
1 per cent would have been oppressive to business,
since it would have corresponded to a very high rate
of real interest. Any one who could have foreseen
the movement even partially would have done well
for himself by selling out his assets and staying out
of business for the time being.</p>

<p>But if the depreciation of money is a source of
gain to the business man, it is also the occasion
of opprobrium. To the consumer the business man’s
exceptional profits appear as the cause (instead of the
consequence) of the hated rise of prices. Amidst
the rapid fluctuations of his fortunes he himself loses
his conservative instincts, and begins to think more of
the large gains of the moment than of the lesser, but
permanent, profits of normal business. The welfare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
of his enterprise in the relatively distant future
weighs less with him than before, and thoughts are
excited of a quick fortune and clearing out. His
excessive gains have come to him unsought and without
fault or design on his part, but once acquired he
does not lightly surrender them, and will struggle
to retain his booty. With such impulses and so
placed, the business man is himself not free from a
suppressed uneasiness. In his heart he loses his
former self-confidence in his relation to society, in
his utility and necessity in the economic scheme.
He fears the future of his business and his class,
and the less secure he feels his fortune to be the
tighter he clings to it. The business man, the prop
of society and the builder of the future, to whose
activities and rewards there had been accorded,
not long ago, an almost religious sanction, he of
all men and classes most respectable, praiseworthy
and necessary, with whom interference was not
only disastrous but almost impious, was now to
suffer sidelong glances, to feel himself suspected
and attacked, the victim of unjust and injurious
laws,—to become, and know himself half-guilty, a
profiteer.</p>

<p>No man of spirit will consent to remain poor if
he believes his betters to have gained their goods
by lucky gambling. To convert the business man
into the profiteer is to strike a blow at capitalism,
because it destroys the psychological equilibrium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
which permits the perpetuance of unequal rewards.
The economic doctrine of normal profits, vaguely
apprehended by every one, is a necessary condition
for the justification of capitalism. The business
man is only tolerable so long as his gains can be
held to bear some relation to what, roughly and
in some sense, his activities have contributed to
society.</p>

<p>This, then, is the second disturbance to the
existing economic order for which the depreciation
of money is responsible. If the fall in the value
of money discourages investment, it also discredits
enterprise.</p>

<p>Not that the business man was allowed, even
during the period of boom, to retain the whole of
his exceptional profits. A host of popular remedies
vainly attempted to cure the evils of the day; which
remedies themselves—subsidies, price and rent fixing,
profiteer hunting, and excess profits duties—eventually
became not the least part of the evils.</p>

<p>In due course came the depression, with falling
prices, which operate on those who hold stocks in
a manner exactly opposite to rising prices. Excessive
losses, bearing no relation to the efficiency of the
business, took the place of windfall gains; and the
effort of every one to hold as small stocks as possible
brought industry to a standstill, just as previously
their efforts to accumulate stocks had over-stimulated
it. Unemployment succeeded Profiteering as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
problem of the hour. But whilst the cyclical movement
of trade and credit has, in the good-currency
countries, partly reversed, for the time being at least,
the great rise of 1920, it has, in the countries of continuing
inflation, made no more than a ripple on the
rapids of depreciation.</p>

<h4 id="sec_4">3. <i>The Earner.</i></h4>

<p>It has been a commonplace of economic text-books
that wages tend to lag behind prices, with the result
that the real earnings of the wage-earner are diminished
during a period of rising prices. This has often
been true in the past, and may be true even now of
certain classes of labour which are ill-placed or ill-organised
for improving their position. But in Great
Britain, at any rate, and in the United States also,
some important sections of labour were able to take
advantage of the situation not only to obtain money
wages equivalent in purchasing power to what they
had before, but to secure a real improvement, to
combine this with a diminution in their hours of work
(and, so far, of the work done), and to accomplish
this (in the case of Great Britain) at a time when the
total wealth of the community as a whole had suffered
a decrease. This reversal of the usual course has not
been due to an accident and is traceable to definite
causes.</p>

<p>The organisation of certain classes of labour—railwaymen,
miners, dockers, and others—for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
purpose of securing wage increases is better than
it was. Life in the army, perhaps for the first
time in the history of wars, raised in many respects
the conventional standard of requirements,—the
soldier was better clothed, better shod, and often
better fed than the labourer, and his wife, adding
in war time a separation allowance to new opportunities
to earn, had also enlarged her ideas.</p>

<p>But these influences, while they would have
supplied the motive, might have lacked the means
to the result if it had not been for another factor—the
windfalls of the profiteer. The fact that the
business man had been gaining, and gaining notoriously,
considerable windfall profits in excess of the
normal profits of trade, laid him open to pressure,
not only from his employees but from public opinion
generally; and enabled him to meet this pressure
without financial difficulty. In fact, it was worth
his while to pay ransom, and to share with his workmen
the good fortune of the day.</p>

<p>Thus the working classes improved their <em>relative</em>
position in the years following the war, as against
all other classes except that of the “profiteers.” In
some important cases they improved their absolute
position—that is to say, account being taken of
shorter hours, increased money wages, and higher
prices, some sections of the working classes secured
for themselves a higher real remuneration for each
unit of effort or work done. But we cannot estimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the <em>stability</em> of this state of affairs, as contrasted with
its desirability, unless we know the source from which
the increased reward of the working classes was
drawn. Was it due to a permanent modification of
the economic factors which determine the distribution
of the national product between different classes?
Or was it due to some temporary and exhaustible
influence connected with inflation and with the resulting
disturbance in the standard of value?</p>

<p>A violent disturbance of the standard of value
obscures the true situation, and for a time one class
can benefit at the expense of another surreptitiously
and without producing immediately the inevitable
reaction. In such conditions a country can without
knowing it expend in current consumption those
savings which it thinks it is investing for the future;
and it can even trench on existing capital or fail
to make good its current depreciation. When the
value of money is greatly fluctuating, the distinction
between capital and income becomes confused.
It is one of the evils of a depreciating currency
that it enables a community to live on its capital
unawares. The increasing <em>money</em> value of the community’s
capital goods obscures temporarily a diminution
in the real quantity of the stock.</p>

<p>The period of depression has exacted its penalty
from the working classes more in the form of unemployment
than by a lowering of real wages, and
State assistance to the unemployed has greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
moderated even this penalty. Money wages have
followed prices downwards. But the depression of
1921–22 did not reverse or even greatly diminish
the relative advantage gained by the working classes
over the middle class during the previous years.
In 1923 British wage rates stood at an appreciably
higher level above the pre-war rates than did the
cost of living, if allowance is made for the shorter
hours worked.</p>

<p>In Germany and Austria also, but in a far greater
degree than in England or in France, the change in
the value of money has thrown the burden of hard
circumstances on the middle class, and hitherto the
labouring class have by no means supported their
full proportionate share. If it be true that university
professors in Germany have some responsibility for
the atmosphere which bred war, their class has paid
the penalty. The effects of the impoverishment,
throughout Europe, of the middle class, out of which
most good things have sprung, must slowly accumulate
in a decay of Science and Art.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>We conclude that Inflation redistributes wealth
in a manner very injurious to the investor, very
beneficial to the business man, and probably, in
modern industrial conditions, beneficial on the whole
to the earner. Its most striking consequence is its
<em>injustice</em> to those who in good faith have committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
their savings to titles to money rather than to things.
But injustice on such a scale has further consequences.
The above discussion suggests that the
diminution in the production of wealth which has
taken place in Europe since the war has been, to a
certain extent, at the expense, not of the consumption
of any class, but of the accumulation of capital.
Moreover, Inflation has not only diminished the
capacity of the investing class to save but has
destroyed the atmosphere of confidence which is a
condition of the willingness to save. Yet a growing
population requires, for the maintenance of the
same standard of life, a proportionate growth of
capital. In Great Britain for many years to come,
regardless of what the birth-rate may be from now
onwards (and at the present time the number of
births per day is nearly double the number of deaths),
upwards of 250,000 new labourers will enter the
labour market annually in excess of those going out
of it. To maintain this growing body of labour at
the same standard of life as before, we require not
merely growing markets but a growing capital equipment.
In order to keep our standards from deterioration,
the national capital must grow as fast as the
national labour supply, which means new savings
of at least £250,000,000<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">7</a> per annum at present.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
The favourable conditions for saving which existed
in the nineteenth century, even though we smile
at them, provided a proportionate growth between
capital and population. The disturbance of the pre-existing
balance between classes, which in its origins
is largely traceable to the changes in the value of
money, may have destroyed these favourable conditions.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">7</a> That is to say, it costs not less than £1000 in new capital outlay to
equip a working man with organisation and appliances, which will render
his labour efficient, and to house and supply himself and his family. Indeed
this is probably an underestimate.</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand Deflation, as we shall see in the
second section of the next chapter, is liable, in these
days of huge national debts expressed in legal-tender
money, to overturn the balance so far the other way
in the interests of the <em>rentier</em>, that the burden of taxation

<h3 id="sec_5">II.—<span class="smcap">Changes in the Value of Money,
As affecting Production.</span></h3>

<p>If, for any reason right or wrong, the business
world <em>expects</em> that prices will fall, the processes of
production tend to be inhibited; and if it expects
that prices will rise, they tend to be over-stimulated.
A fluctuation in the measuring-rod of value does not
alter in the least the wealth of the world, the needs
of the world, or the productive capacity of the world.
It ought not, therefore, to affect the character or the
volume of what is produced. A movement of <em>relative</em>
prices, that is to say of the comparative prices of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
different commodities, <em>ought</em> to influence the character
of production, because it is an indication that various
commodities are not being produced in the exactly
right proportions. But this is not true of a change,
as such, in the <em>general</em> price level.</p>

<p>The fact that the expectation of changes in the
<em>general</em> price level affects the processes of production,
is deeply rooted in the peculiarities of the existing
economic organisation of society, partly in those
described in the preceding sections of this chapter,
partly in others to be mentioned in a moment. We
have already seen that a change in the general level
of prices, that is to say a change in the measuring-rod,
which fixes the obligation of the borrowers of
money (who make the decisions which set production
in motion) to the lenders (who are inactive once they
have lent their money), effects a redistribution of real
wealth between the two groups. Furthermore, the
active group can, if they foresee such a change, alter
their action in advance in such a way as to minimise
their losses to the other group or to increase their
gains from it, if and when the expected change in the
value of money occurs. If they expect a fall, it may
pay them, as a group, to damp production down,
although such enforced idleness impoverishes society
as a whole. If they expect a rise, it may pay them
to increase their borrowings and to swell production
beyond the point where the real return is just sufficient
to recompense society as a whole for the effort made.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Sometimes, of course, a change in the measuring-rod,
especially if it is unforeseen, may benefit one group
at the expense of the other disproportionately to any
influence it exerts on the volume of production; but
the tendency, in so far as the active group anticipate
a change, will be as I have described it.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">8</a> This is
simply to say that the intensity of production is
largely governed in existing conditions by the
anticipated real profit of the <em>entrepreneur</em>. Yet this
criterion is the right one for the community as a
whole only when the delicate adjustment of interests
is not upset by fluctuations in the standard of value.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="fnanchor">8</a> The interests of the salaried and wage-earning classes will, in so far
as their salaries and wages tend to be steadier in money-value than in real-value,
coincide with those of the inactive capitalist group. The interests
of the consumer will, in so far as he can vary the distribution of his floating
resources between cash and goods purchased in advance of consumption,
coincide with those of the active capitalist group; and his decisions, made
in his own interests, may serve to reinforce the effect of those of the latter.
But that the interests of the same individual will often be those of one
of the groups in one of his capacities and of the other in another of his
capacities, does not save the situation or affect the argument. For his losses
in one capacity depend only infinitesimally on him personally refraining from
action in his other capacity. The facts, that a man is a cannibal at home
and eaten abroad, do not cancel out to render him innocuous and safe.</p>

</div>

<p>But there is a further reason, connected with
the above but nevertheless distinct, why modern
methods of production require a stable standard,—a
reason springing to a certain extent out of the
character of the social organisation described above,
but aggravated by the technical methods of present-day
productive processes. With the development of
international trade, involving great distances between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the place of original production and the place of final
consumption, and with the increased complication of
the technical processes of manufacture, the amount
of <em>risk</em> which attaches to the undertaking of production
and the length of time through which this risk
must be carried are much greater than they would
be in a comparatively small self-contained community.
Even in agriculture, whilst the risk to the
consumer is diminished by drawing supplies from
many different sources, which average the fluctuations
of the seasons, the risk to the agricultural producer is
increased, since, when his crop falls below his expectations
in volume, he may fail to be compensated by a
higher price. This increased risk is the price which
producers have to pay for the other advantages of a
high degree of specialisation and for the variety of
their markets and their sources of supply.</p>

<p>The provision of adequate facilities for the carrying
of this risk at a moderate cost is one of the greatest
of the problems of modern economic life, and one of
those which so far have been least satisfactorily solved.
The business of keeping the productive machine in
continuous operation (and thereby avoiding unemployment)
would be greatly simplified if this risk could
be diminished or if we could devise a better means of
insurance against it for the individual <em>entrepreneur</em>.</p>

<p>A considerable part of the risk arises out of fluctuations
in the <em>relative</em> value of a commodity compared
with that of commodities in general during the interval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
which must elapse between the commencement of
production and the time of consumption. This part
of the risk is independent of the vagaries of money,
and must be tackled by methods with which we are
not concerned here. But there is also a considerable
risk directly arising out of instability in the value of
money. During the lengthy process of production
the business world is incurring outgoings in terms of
<em>money</em>—paying out in money for wages and other
expenses of production—in the expectation of recouping
this outlay by disposing of the product for <em>money</em>
at a later date. That is to say, the business world
as a whole must always be in a position where it
stands to gain by a rise of price and to lose by a fall
of price. Whether it likes it or not, the technique
of production under a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i> of money-contract forces
the business world always to carry a big speculative
position; and if it is reluctant to carry this position,
the productive process must be slackened. The argument
is not affected by the fact that there is some
degree of specialisation of function within the business
world, in so far as the professional speculator comes
to the assistance of the producer proper by taking
over from him a part of his risk.</p>

<p>Now it follows from this, not merely that the
<em>actual occurrence</em> of price changes profits some classes
and injures others (which has been the theme of the
first section of this chapter), but that a <em>general fear</em>
of falling prices may inhibit the productive process<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
altogether. For if prices are expected to fall, not
enough risk-takers can be found who are willing to
carry a speculative “bull” position, and this means
that <em>entrepreneurs</em> will be reluctant to embark on
lengthy productive processes involving a money outlay
long in advance of money recoupment,—whence
unemployment. The <em>fact</em> of falling prices injures
<em>entrepreneurs</em>; consequently the <em>fear</em> of falling prices
causes them to protect themselves by curtailing their
operations; yet it is upon the aggregate of their
individual estimations of the risk, and their willingness
to run the risk, that the activity of production and
of employment mainly depends.</p>

<p>There is a further aggravation of the case, in that
an expectation about the course of prices tends, if it
is widely held, to be cumulative in its results up to a
certain point. If prices are expected to rise and the
business world acts on this expectation, that very
fact causes them to rise for a time and, by verifying
the expectation, reinforces it; and similarly, if it
expects them to fall. Thus a comparatively weak
initial impetus may be adequate to produce a considerable
fluctuation.</p>

<p>Three generations of economists have recognised
that certain influences produce a progressive and continuing
change in the value of money, that others
produce in it an oscillatory movement, and that the
latter act cumulatively in their initial stages but
produce the conditions for a reaction after a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
point. But their investigations into the oscillatory
movements have been chiefly confined, until lately,
to the question what kind of cause is responsible for
the initial impetus. Some have been fascinated by
the idea that the initial cause is always the same and
is astronomically regular in the times of its appearance.
Others have maintained, more plausibly, that
sometimes one thing operates and sometimes another.</p>

<p>It is one of the objects of this book to urge that the
best way to cure this mortal disease of individualism
is to provide that there shall never exist any confident
expectation either that prices generally are going to
fall or that they are going to rise; and also that
there shall be no serious risk that a movement, if it
does occur, will be a big one. If, unexpectedly and
accidentally, a moderate movement were to occur,
wealth, though it might be redistributed, would not
be diminished thereby.</p>

<p>To procure this result by removing all possible
influences towards an initial movement, whether such
influences are to be found in the skies only or everywhere,
would seem to be a hopeless enterprise. The
remedy would lie, rather, in so controlling the standard
of value that, whenever something occurred which,
left to itself, would create an expectation of a change
in the general level of prices, the controlling authority
should take steps to counteract this expectation by
setting in motion some factor of a contrary tendency.
Even if such a policy were not wholly successful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
either in counteracting expectations or in avoiding
actual movements, it would be an improvement on
the policy of sitting quietly by, whilst a standard of
value, governed by chance causes and deliberately
removed from central control, produces expectations
which paralyse or intoxicate the government of
production.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>We see, therefore, that rising prices and falling
prices each have their characteristic disadvantage.
The Inflation which causes the former means Injustice
to individuals and to classes,—particularly to investors;
and is therefore unfavourable to saving.
The Deflation which causes falling prices means
Impoverishment to labour and to enterprise by leading
<em>entrepreneurs</em> to restrict production, in their
endeavour to avoid loss to themselves; and is therefore
disastrous to employment. The counterparts
are, of course, also true,—namely that Deflation
means Injustice to borrowers, and that Inflation leads
to the over-stimulation of industrial activity. But
these results are not so marked as those emphasised
above, because borrowers are in a better position to
protect themselves from the worst effects of Deflation
than lenders are to protect themselves from those of
Inflation, and because labour is in a better position
to protect itself from over-exertion in good times
than from under-employment in bad times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>Thus Inflation is unjust and Deflation is inexpedient.
Of the two perhaps Deflation is, if we rule
out exaggerated inflations such as that of Germany,
the worse; because it is worse, in an impoverished
world, to provoke unemployment than to disappoint
the <em>rentier</em>. But it is not necessary that we should
weigh one evil against the other. It is easier to
agree that both are evils to be shunned. The
Individualistic Capitalism of to-day, precisely because
it entrusts saving to the individual investor and
production to the individual employer, <em>presumes</em> a
stable measuring-rod of value, and cannot be efficient—perhaps
cannot survive—without one.</p>

<p>For these grave causes we must free ourselves
from the deep distrust which exists against allowing
the regulation of the standard of value to be the
subject of <em>deliberate decision</em>. We can no longer
afford to leave it in the category of which the distinguishing
characteristics are possessed in different
degrees by the weather, the birth-rate, and the
Constitution,—matters which are settled by natural
causes, or are the resultant of the separate action of
many individuals acting independently, or require a
Revolution to change them.</p>

VALUE OF MONEY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_6">I. <i>Inflation as a Method of Taxation</i></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">A Government</span> can live for a long time, even the
German Government or the Russian Government, by
printing paper money. That is to say, it can by this
means secure the command over real resources,—resources
just as real as those obtained by taxation.
The method is condemned, but its efficacy, up to a
point, must be admitted. A Government can live by
this means when it can live by no other. It is the form
of taxation which the public find hardest to evade and
even the weakest Government can enforce, when it
can enforce nothing else. Of this character have been
the progressive and catastrophic inflations practised in
Central and Eastern Europe, as distinguished from
the limited and oscillatory inflations, experienced for
example in Great Britain and the United States, which
have been examined in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>The Quantity Theory of Money states that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
amount of cash which the community requires, <em>assuming
certain habits of business and of banking to be
established</em>, and assuming also a given level and
distribution of wealth, depends on the level of prices.
If the consumption and production of actual goods
are unaltered but prices and wages are doubled, then
twice as much cash as before is required to do the
business. The truth of this, properly explained and
qualified, it is foolish to deny. The Theory infers from
this that the <em>aggregate real value</em> of all the paper money
in circulation remains more or less the same, irrespective
of the <em>number of units</em> of it in circulation,
provided the habits and prosperity of the people are
not changed,—<i>i.e.</i> the community retains in the
shape of cash the command over a more or less constant
amount of real wealth, which is the same thing
as to say that the total quantity of money in circulation
has a more or less fixed purchasing power.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="fnanchor">9</a> See also Chapter III., <a href="#sec_8">Section I</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Let us suppose that there are in circulation
9,000,000 currency notes, and that they have
altogether a value equivalent to 36,000,000 gold
dollars.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">10</a> Suppose that the Government prints a
further 3,000,000 notes, so that the amount of
currency is now 12,000,000; then, in accordance with
the above theory, the 12,000,000 notes are still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
only equivalent to $36,000,000. In the first state
of affairs, therefore, each note = $4, and in the second
state of affairs each note = $3. Consequently the
9,000,000 notes originally held by the public are
now worth $27,000,000 instead of $36,000,000, and
the 3,000,000 notes newly issued by the Government
are worth $9,000,000. Thus by the process of
printing the additional notes the Government has
transferred from the public to itself an amount of
resources equal to $9,000,000, just as successfully as
if it had raised this sum in taxation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="fnanchor">10</a> It will simplify the argument to ignore the fact that the value of gold
in terms of commodities is itself a fluctuating one, and to treat the value
of a currency in terms of gold as a rough measure of its value in terms of
“real resources” generally.</p>

</div>

<p>On whom has the tax fallen? Clearly on the
holders of the original 9,000,000 notes, whose notes
are now worth 25 per cent less than they were before.
The inflation has amounted to a tax of 25 per cent
on all holders of notes in proportion to their holdings.
The burden of the tax is well spread, cannot be
evaded, costs nothing to collect, and falls, in a rough
sort of way, in proportion to the wealth of the victim.
No wonder its superficial advantages have attracted
Ministers of Finance.</p>

<p>Temporarily, the yield of the tax is even a little
better for the Government than by the above calculation.
For the new notes can be passed off
at first at the same value as though there were
still only 9,000,000 notes altogether. It is only
after the new notes get into circulation and people
begin to spend them that they realise that the notes
are worth less than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>What is there to prevent the Government from
repeating this process over and over again? The
reader must observe that the aggregate note issue
is still worth $36,000,000. If, therefore, the Government
now prints a further 4,000,000 notes, there
will be 16,000,000 notes altogether, which by the
same argument as before are worth $2.25 each instead
of $3, and by issuing the 4,000,000 notes the Government
has, just as before, transferred an amount
of resources equal to $9,000,000 from the public
to itself. The holders of notes have again suffered
a tax of 25 per cent in proportion to their holdings.</p>

<p>Like other forms of taxation, these exactions, if
overdone and out of proportion to the wealth of the
community, must diminish its prosperity and lower
its standards, so that at the lower standard of life
the aggregate value of the currency may fall and
still be enough to go round. But this effect cannot
interfere very much with the efficacy of taxing by
inflation. Even if the aggregate real value of the
currency falls for these reasons to a half or two-thirds
of what it was before, which represents a
tremendous lowering of the standards of life, this
only means that the quantity of notes which the
Government must issue in order to obtain a given
result must be raised proportionately. It remains
true that by this means the Government can still
secure for itself a large share of the available surplus
of the community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>Has the public in the last resort no remedy, no
means of protecting itself against these ingenious
depredations? It has only one remedy,—to change
its habits in the use of money. The initial assumption
on which our argument rested was that the community
did <em>not</em> change its habits in the use of money.</p>

<p>Experience shows that the public generally is
very slow to grasp the situation and embrace the
remedy. Indeed, at first there may be a change of
habit in the wrong direction, which actually facilitates
the Government’s operations. The public is so much
accustomed to thinking of money as the ultimate
standard, that, when prices begin to rise, believing
that the rise must be temporary, they tend to
hoard their money and to postpone purchases,
with the result that they hold in monetary form a
<em>larger</em> aggregate of real value than before. And,
similarly, when the fall in the real value of the money
is reflected in the exchanges, foreigners, thinking that
the fall is abnormal and temporary, purchase the
money for the purpose of hoarding it.</p>

<p>But sooner or later the second phase sets in.
The public discover that it is the holders of notes
who suffer taxation and defray the expenses of government,
and they begin to change their habits and
to economise in their holding of notes. They can
do this in various ways:—(1) instead of keeping some
part of their ultimate reserves in money they can
spend this money on durable objects, jewellery or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
household goods, and keep their reserves in this
form instead; (2) they can reduce the amount of
till-money and pocket-money that they keep and the
average length of time for which they keep it,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">11</a> even
at the cost of great personal inconvenience; and
(3) they can employ foreign money in many transactions
where it would have been more natural and
convenient to use their own.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="fnanchor">11</a> In Moscow the unwillingness to hold money except for the shortest
possible time reached at one period a fantastic intensity. If a grocer sold
a pound of cheese, he ran off with the roubles as fast as his legs could carry
him to the Central Market to replenish his stocks by changing them into
cheese again, lest they lost their value before he got there; thus justifying
the prevision of economists in naming the phenomenon “velocity of circulation”!
In Vienna, during the period of collapse, mushroom exchange
banks sprang up at every street corner, where you could change your
krone into Zurich francs within a few minutes of receiving them, and so
avoid the risk of loss during the time it would take you to reach your usual
bank. It became a seasonable witticism to allege that a prudent man
at a café ordering a bock of beer should order a second bock at the same
time, even at the expense of drinking it tepid, lest the price should rise
meanwhile.</p>

</div>

<p>By these means they can get along and do their
business with an amount of notes having an aggregate
real value substantially less than before. For example,
the notes in circulation become worth altogether
$20,000,000 instead of $36,000,000, with the result
that the next inflationary levy by the Government,
falling on a smaller amount, must be at a greater rate
in order to yield a given sum.</p>

<p>When the public take alarm faster than they can
change their habits, and, in their efforts to avoid
loss, run down the amount of real resources, which
they hold in the form of money, <em>below</em> the working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
minimum, seeking to supply their daily needs
for cash by borrowing, they get penalised, as in
Germany in 1923, by prodigious rates of money-interest.
The rates rise, as we have seen in the
previous chapter, until the rate of interest on money
equals or exceeds the anticipated rate of the depreciation
of money. Indeed it is always likely, when
money is rapidly depreciating, that there will be recurrent
periods of scarcity of currency, because the
public, in their anxiety not to hold too much money,
will fail to provide themselves even with the minimum
which they will require in practice.</p>

<p>Whilst economists have sometimes described these
phenomena in terms of an increase in the velocity of
circulation due to loss of confidence in the currency;
nevertheless there are not, I think, many passages
in economic literature where the matter is clearly
analysed. Professor Cannan’s article on “The Application
of the Apparatus of Supply and Demand to
Units of Currency” (<cite>Economic Journal</cite>, December
1921) is one of the most noteworthy. He points out
that the common assumption that “the elasticity of
demand for money is unity” is equivalent to the
assertion that a mere variation in the quantity of
money does not affect the willingness and habits of
the public as holders of purchasing power in that
form. But in extreme cases this assumption does
not hold; for if it did, there would be no limit to
the sums which the Government could extract from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
the public by means of inflation. It is, therefore,
unsafe to assume that the elasticity of demand is
necessarily unity. Professor Lehfeldt followed this
up in a subsequent issue of the <cite>Economic Journal</cite>
(December 1922) by a calculation of the actual
elasticity of demand for money in some recent instances.
He found that between July 1920 and
April 1922, the elasticity of demand for money fell
to an average of about ·73 in Austria, ·67 in Poland,
and ·5 in Germany. Thus in the last stages of inflation
the prodigious increase in the velocity of
circulation may have as much, or more, effect in
raising prices and depreciating the exchanges than
the increase in the volume of notes. The note-issuing
authorities often cry out against what they regard as
the unfair and anomalous fact of the notes falling in
value <em>more</em> than in proportion to their increased
volume. Yet it is nothing of the kind; it is merely
the result of the one method to evade a crushing
burden left open to the public, who discover for themselves,
sooner than the financiers, that the law of unit
elasticity in their demand for money can be escaped.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is evident that so long as the public
use money at all, the Government can continue to
raise resources by inflation. Moreover, the conveniences
of using money in daily life are so great that the
public are prepared, rather than forego them, to pay
the inflationary tax, provided it is not raised to a
prohibitive level. Like other conveniences of life the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
use of money is taxable, and, although for various
reasons this particular form of taxation is highly inexpedient,
a Government can get resources by a
<em>continuous</em> practice of inflation, even when this is
foreseen by the public generally, unless the sums they
seek to raise in this way are very grossly excessive.
Just as a toll can be levied on the use of roads or a
turnover tax on business transactions, so also on the
use of money. The higher the toll and the tax, the
less traffic on the roads, and the less business transacted,
so also the less money carried. But some
traffic is so indispensable, some business so profitable,
some money-payments so convenient, that only a
very high levy will stop completely all traffic,
all business, all payments. A Government has to
remember, however, that even if a tax is not prohibitive
it may be unprofitable, and that a medium,
rather than an extreme, imposition will yield the
greatest gain.</p>

<p>Suppose that the rate of inflation is such that the
value of the money falls by half every year, and
suppose that the cash used by the public for retail
purchases in shops is turned over 100 times a year
(<i>i.e.</i> stays in one pocket for half a week on the average);
then this is only equivalent to a turnover tax
of ½ per cent on each transaction. The public will
gladly pay such a tax rather than suffer the trouble
and inconvenience of barter with trams and tradesmen.
Even if the value of the money falls by half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
every month, the public, by keeping their pocket-money
so low that they turn it over once a day on
the average instead of only twice a week, can still
keep the tax down to the equivalent of less than 2 per
cent on each transaction, or more precisely 4d. in the
£. Even such a terrific rate of depreciation as this is
not sufficient, therefore, to counterbalance the advantages
of using money rather than barter in the
trifling business of daily life. This is the explanation
why, even in Germany and in Russia, the Government’s
notes remained current for many retail transactions.</p>

<p>For certain other purposes, however, to which
money is put in a modern community, the inflationary
tax becomes prohibitive at a much earlier stage. As
a store of value, for example, money is rapidly discarded,
as soon as further depreciation is confidently
anticipated. As a unit of account, for contracts and
for balance sheets, it quickly becomes worse than useless,
although for such purposes the privilege of the
current money as legal-tender for the discharge of
debts stands in the way of its being discarded as soon
as it ought to be.</p>

<p>In the last phase, when the use of the legal-tender
money has been discarded for all purposes except
trifling out-of-pocket expenditure, inflationary taxation
has at last defeated itself. For in that case the
total value of the note issue, which is sufficient to
meet the public’s minimum requirements, amounts to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
a figure relatively so trifling that the amount of resources
which the government can hope to raise by
yet further inflation—without pushing it to a point at
which the money will be discarded even for out-of-pocket
trifles—is correspondingly small. Thus at last,
unless it is employed with some measure of moderation,
this potent instrument of governmental exaction
breaks in the hands of those that use it, and leaves
them at the same time with the rest of their fiscal
system in total ruins;—out of which, in the ebb and
flow of the economic life of nations, may emerge
once more a reformed and admirable system. The
chervonetz of Moscow and the krone of Vienna are
already stabler units than the franc or the lira.</p>

(see <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a> below).</p>

</div>

<p>The characteristics of each phase emerge clearly.
The tables show, first of all, how quickly, during the
period of collapse, the rate of the depreciation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
value of the money outstrips the rate of the inflation
of its volume. During the collapse of the German
mark beginning with December 1920, the rate of
depreciation proceeded for some time roughly twice
as fast as that of the inflation, and eventually by June
1923, when the volume of the note-issue had increased
200-fold compared with December 1920, the value of
a paper mark had fallen 2500-fold. The figures given
above for Austria begin at a rather later stage of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débâcle</i>. But if we equate Austria in June 1920 to
Germany in December 1920, the progress of events
between that date and September 1922 is roughly
comparable to that in Germany between December
1920 and May 1923. The figures for Russia between
January 1919 and the early part of 1923 also exhibit
the same general features.</p>

<p>These tables all commence after a considerable
depreciation had already occurred and the gold-value
of the aggregate note-issue had fallen considerably
below the normal.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">12</a> Nevertheless their earliest entries
still belong to the period when an eventual recovery
was still widely anticipated and the general public
had not at all appreciated what they were in for.
They indicate that as the situation develops from this
point onwards and the use of money is discarded
except for retail transactions, the aggregate value of
the note-issue falls by about four-fifths. As the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
of extreme panic or depression a further fall may
occur for a time; but, unless the money is discarded
altogether, a minimum is reached eventually from
which the least favourable circumstance will cause a
sharp recovery.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">12</a> The pre-war currency of Germany was estimated at about 6 milliard
gold marks (£300,000,000), or nearly £5 per head.</p>

</div>

<p>The temporary recovery in Germany after the
collapse of February 1923 exhibited how a point may
come when, if the money is to continue in use at all,
a bottom is reached and a technical position is created
in which some recovery is possible. When the gold
value of the currency has fallen to a very low figure,
it is easy for the Government, if it has any external
resources at all, to give sufficient support to prevent
the exchange from falling further for the time being.
And since by that time the public will have carried
their attempts to economise the use of money to a
pitch of inconvenience which it is impracticable to
continue, even a moderate weakening in the degree
of their distrust of the future value of the money
will lead to some increase in their use of it; with the
result that the aggregate value of the note issue will
tend to recover. By February 1923 these conditions
existed in Germany in a high degree. The German
Government was able within two months, in the face
of most adverse political conditions, to double the
exchange-value of the mark whilst simultaneously
more than doubling the note circulation. Even so
the gold value of the note issue was only brought
back to what it had been six months earlier; and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
even a moderate degree of confidence had been
restored, it might have been possible to bring the
value of the note circulation of Germany up to (say)
2 milliard gold marks (£100,000,000) at least, which
is probably about the lowest figure at which it can
stand permanently, unless every one is to put himself
to intolerable inconvenience in his efforts to hold
as little money as possible. Incidentally the Government
is able during the period of recovery to obtain,
once more, through the issue of notes the command
over a considerable amount of real resources.</p>

<p>In Austria, where, at the date of writing, the
exchange has been stabilised for a year, the same
phenomenon has been apparent with the growth of
confidence, the gold value of the note issue having been
raised to nearly two and a half times the low point
reached in September 1922. The fact of stabilisation,
with foreign aid, has, by increasing confidence, permitted
this increase of the note issue without imperilling
the stabilisation, and will probably permit
in course of time a substantial further increase.</p>

<p>Even in Russia a sort of equilibrium seems to have
been reached. There the last phase had appeared
by the middle of 1922, when a tenfold inflation in
six months<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">13</a> had brought the aggregate value of the
note issue below £4,000,000, which clearly could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
be adequate for the transaction of the business of
Russia even in its present condition. A point had
been reached when the use of paper roubles was
being dispensed with altogether. At about that date
I had the opportunity of discussion at Genoa with
some of the Soviet financiers. They have always
been more self-conscious and deliberate than others
in their monetary policy. They maintained at that
time that, with the help of legal compulsion to employ
paper roubles for certain types of transaction, these
roubles could always be maintained in circulation up
to a certain <em>minimum</em> real value, however certain the
public might be as to their ultimate worthlessness.
According to this calculation, it would always be
possible to raise (say) £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 per
annum by this method, even though the paper rouble
regularly fell in value at the rate of a tenfold or a
hundredfold a year (one or more noughts being
struck off the monetary unit annually for convenience
of calculation). During the year following they did,
in fact, decidedly better than this, and, by reducing
the rate of inflation to a figure not much in excess of
100 per cent per three months, were able to raise the
aggregate value of the note issue to more than double
the lowest point reached. The equivalent of something
like £15,000,000 seems to have been raised
during the year (April 1922–April 1923) by this means
towards the expenses of government, at the cost of
having to strike only one nought off the monetary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
unit for the whole year!<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">14</a> At the same time, in order
to furnish a reliable store of value and a basis for
foreign trade, the Soviet Government introduced in
December 1922 a new currency unit (the chervonetz,
or gold ducat), freely convertible on sterling-exchange
standard principles, alongside the paper rouble, which
was still indispensable as an instrument of taxation.
So far this new bank note has kept respectable.
By August 1923 its circulation had risen to nearly
16,000,000 having a value of about £16,000,000, and
its exchange value had kept steady, the State Bank
undertaking to convert the chervonetz on a parity
with the £ sterling.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">15</a> Thus by the middle of 1923 the
aggregate value of the Russian note issues, good and
bad money together, had risen to the substantial figure
of £25,000,000, as compared with barely £4,000,000
at the date of the Genoa Conference in May 1922,
thus indicating the return of confidence and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
re-inauguration of a monetary <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i>. Russia provides
an instructive example (at least for the moment) of
a sound money for substantial transactions alongside
small change for daily life, the progressive depreciation
on which merely represents a quite supportable
rate of turn-over tax.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="fnanchor">13</a> Recent experience everywhere seems to show that it is possible to
inflate 100 per cent every three months without entirely killing the use of
money in retail transactions, but that a greater rate of inflation than this
can only be indulged in at the peril of total collapse.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">14</a> The Soviet Government have always regarded monetary inflation

<p>The collapse of the currency in Germany which
was the chief contributory cause to the fall of Dr.
Cuno’s Government in August 1923, was due, not so
much to taxing by inflation—for that had been going
on for years—as to an increase in the <em>rate</em> of inflation
to a level almost prohibitive for daily transactions
and quite destructive of the legal-tender money as a
unit of account. We have seen that what concerns
the use of money in the retail transactions of daily
life is the <em>rate</em> of depreciation, rather than the absolute
amount of depreciation as compared with some
earlier date.</p>

<p>In the middle of 1922 I estimated, very roughly,
that the German Government had then been obtaining
for some time past the equivalent of something
between £75,000,000 and £100,000,000 per annum by
means of printing money. Up to that time, however,
a substantial proportion of these receipts had
been contributed through the purchase of mark-notes
by speculative foreigners. Nevertheless the German
public itself had probably paid upwards of £50,000,000
per annum in this form of taxation. Since the
German note issue was still worth £240,000,000 so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
lately as December 1920 (see the <a href="#t51">table</a> on p. 51) and
had not fallen below £100,000,000 even in the middle
of 1922, the rate of depreciation represented by the
above, whilst sufficiently disastrous to the mark as
a store of value or as a unit of account, had been by
no means prohibitive to its continued use in daily
life. In the latter half of 1922, however, the public
learnt to make enough further economies in the use
of the mark as money to reduce the value of the total
note issue to about £60,000,000. The first effect of
the Ruhr occupation was, as we have seen above
(<a href="#Page_54">p. 54</a>), to bring down the note issue below the
minimum to which the public could adjust their
habits, which resulted in the temporary recovery of
March 1923. Nevertheless by the middle of 1923 the
public was able to get along with a note issue worth
about £20,000,000. All this time the German Government
had continued to raise resources equivalent to
round about £1,000,000 a week by note-printing—which
meant a depreciation of 5 per cent a week
even if the public had been unable to reduce any
further the value of the aggregate note issue, and
came in practice to about 10 per cent a week allowing
for their yet further economies in the use of
mark-currency.</p>

<p>But the expenses of the Ruhr resistance, coupled
with the complete breakdown of other sources of taxation,
had led, by May and June 1923, to the Government’s
raising the equivalent of, first, £2,000,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
and then £3,000,000 a week by note-printing. On a
note issue, of which the total value had sunk by that
time to about £20,000,000, this was pushing inflationary
taxation to a preposterous and suicidal point.
The social disorganisation, resulting from a rapid
movement to do without the mark altogether, quickly
resulted in Dr. Cuno’s fall.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">16</a> The climax was reached
when, in Dr. Cuno’s last days, the Government
doubled the note issue in a week and raised the
equivalent of £3,000,000 in that period out of a note
issue worth about £4,000,000 altogether,—a performance
far transcending the wildest extravagances of
the Soviet.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">16</a> It is necessary to admit that Dr. Cuno’s failure to control incompetence
at the Treasury and at the Reichsbank was bound to bring this about.
During this catastrophic period those responsible for the financial policy
of Germany did not do a single wise thing, or show the least appreciation
of what was happening. The profits of note-printing were not even
monopolised by the Government, and Herr Havenstein continued to allow
the German banks to share in them, by discounting their bills at the
Reichsbank at a rate of discount far below the rate of depreciation. Only
at the end of August 1923 did the Reichsbank begin to require that borrowers
should make good on repayment a percentage of the loss due to the depreciation
of the borrowed marks (as reckoned by the dollar exchange) during
the currency of the loan.</p>

</div>

<p>By the time this book is published, Dr. Cuno’s
successors may have solved, or failed to solve, the
problem facing them. However this may be, the
restoration of a serviceable unit of account seems to
be the first step. This is a necessary preliminary to
the escape of the German financial system from the
vicious circle in which it now moves. The Government
cannot introduce a sound money, because, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
the absence of other revenue, the printing of an
unsound money is the only way by which it can live.
Yet a serviceable unit of account is a pre-requisite
of the collection of the normal sources of revenue.
The best course, therefore, is to remain content for
a little longer with an unsound money as a source
of revenue, but to introduce immediately a steady
unit of account (the relation of which to the unsound
money could be officially fixed daily or weekly) as
a preliminary to the restoration of the normal sources
of revenue.</p>

<p>The recent history of German finance can be
summarised thus. Reliance on inflationary taxation,
whilst extremely productive to the exchequer in its
earliest stages especially whilst the foreign speculator
was still buying paper marks, gradually broke down
the mark as a serviceable unit of account, one
of the effects of which was to render unproductive
the greater part of the rest of the revenue-collecting
machinery—most taxes being necessarily
assessed at some interval of time before they are
collected. The failure of the rest of the revenue
rendered the Treasury more and more dependent on
inflation, until finally the use of legal-tender money
had been so far abandoned by the public that even
the inflationary tax ceased to be productive and the
Government was threatened by literal bankruptcy.
At this stage, the fiscal organisation of the country
had been so thoroughly destroyed and its social and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
economic organisation so grievously disordered, as
in Russia eighteen months earlier, that it was a perplexing
problem to devise ways and means by which
the Government could live during the transitional
period whilst the normal machinery for collecting
revenue was being re-created, especially in face of the
struggle with France proceeding at the same time.
Nevertheless the problem is not insoluble; many
suggestions could be made; and a way out will
doubtless be found at length.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It is common to speak as though, when a Government
pays its way by inflation, the people of the
country avoid taxation. We have seen that this is
not so. What is raised by printing notes is just as
much taken from the public as is a beer-duty or an
income-tax. What a Government spends the public
pay for. There is no such thing as an uncovered deficit.
But in some countries it seems possible to please and
content the public, for a time at least, by giving
them, in return for the taxes they pay, finely engraved
acknowledgements on water-marked paper. The income-tax
receipts, which we in England receive from
the Surveyor, we throw into the wastepaper basket;
in Germany they call them bank-notes and put them
into their pocket-books; in France they are termed
Rentes and are locked up in the family safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_7">II. <i>Currency Depreciation</i> versus <i>Capital Levy</i></h3>

<p>We have seen in the preceding section the extent
to which a Government can make use of currency
inflation for the purpose of securing income to meet
its outgoings. But there is a second way in which
inflation helps a Government to make both ends
meet, namely by reducing the burden of its pre-existing
liabilities in so far as they have been fixed
in terms of money. These liabilities consist, in the
main, of the internal debt. Every step of depreciation
obviously means a reduction in the real claims
of the <em>rentes</em>-holders against their Government.</p>

<p>It would be too cynical to suppose that, in order
to secure the advantages discussed in this section,
Governments (except, possibly, the Russian Government)
depreciate their currencies <em>on purpose</em>. As a
rule, they are, or consider themselves to be, driven
to it by their necessities. The requirements of the
Treasury to meet sudden exceptional outgoings—for
a war or to pay the consequences of defeat—are
likely to be the original occasion of, at least <em>temporary</em>,
inflation. But the most cogent reason for
<em>permanent</em> depreciation, that is to say <em>Devaluation</em>,
or the policy of fixing the value of the currency
permanently at the low level to which a temporary
emergency has driven it, is generally to be found
in the fact that a restoration of the currency to its
former value would raise the recurrent annual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
burden of the fixed charges of the National Debt
to an insupportable level.</p>

<p>There is, nevertheless, an alternative to Devaluation
in such cases, provided the opponents of Devaluation
are prepared to face it in time, which they generally
are not,—namely a Capital Levy. The purpose of
this section is to bring out clearly the <em>alternative</em>
character of these two methods of moderating the
claims of the <em>rentier</em>, when the State’s contractual
liabilities, fixed in terms of money, have reached an
excessive proportion of the national income.</p>

<p>The active and working elements in no community,
ancient or modern, will consent to hand over to the
<em>rentier</em> or bond-holding class more than a certain
proportion of the fruits of their work. When the
piled-up debt demands more than a tolerable proportion,
relief has usually been sought in one or other
of two out of the three possible methods. The first
is Repudiation. But, except as the accompaniment
of Revolution, this method is too crude, too deliberate,
and too obvious in its incidence. The victims are
immediately aware and cry out too loud; so that,
in the absence of Revolution, this solution may be
ruled out at present, as regards <em>internal</em> debt, in
Western Europe.</p>

<p>The second method is Currency Depreciation,
which becomes Devaluation when it is fixed and
confirmed by law. In the countries of Europe
lately belligerent, this expedient has been adopted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
already on a scale which reduces the real burden
of the debt by from 50 to 100 per cent. In Germany
the National Debt has been by these means
practically obliterated, and the bond-holders have lost
everything. In France the real burden of the debt is
less than a third of what it would be if the franc stood
at par; and in Italy only a quarter. The owners
of small savings suffer quietly, as experience shows,
these enormous depredations, when they would have
thrown down a Government which had taken from
them a fraction of the amount by more deliberate but
juster instruments.</p>

<p>This fact, however, can scarcely justify such an
expedient on its merits. Its indirect evils are many.
Instead of dividing the burden between all classes of
wealth-owners according to a graduated scale, it
throws the whole burden on to the owners of fixed
interest bearing stocks, lets off the <em>entrepreneur</em>
capitalist and even enriches him, and hits small
savings equally with great fortunes. It follows the
line of least resistance, and responsibility cannot be
brought home to individuals. It is, so to speak,
nature’s remedy, which comes into silent operation
when the body politic has shrunk from curing itself.</p>

<p>The remaining, the scientific, expedient, the
Capital Levy, has never yet been tried on a large
scale; and perhaps it never will be. It is the
rational, the deliberate method. But it is difficult to
explain, and it provokes violent prejudice by coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
into conflict with the deep instincts by which the
love of money protects itself. Unless the patient
understands and approves its purpose, he will not
submit to so severe a surgical operation.</p>

<p>Once Currency Depreciation has done its work, I
should not advocate the unwise, and probably impracticable,
policy of retracing the path with the aid of
a Capital Levy. But if it has become clear that the
claims of the bond-holder are more than the taxpayer
can support, and if there is still time to choose between
the policies of a Levy and of further Depreciation,
the Levy must surely be preferred on grounds
both of expediency and of justice. It is an overwhelming
objection to the method of Currency Depreciation,
as compared with that of the Levy, that it
falls entirely upon persons whose wealth is in the form
of claims to legal-tender money, and that these are
generally, amongst the capitalists, the poorer capitalists.
It is entirely ungraduated; it falls on small
savings just as hardly as on big ones; and incidentally
it benefits the capitalist <em>entrepreneur</em> class for the
reasons explained in Chapter I. Unfortunately the
small savers who have most to lose by Currency
Depreciation are precisely the sort of conservative
people who are most alarmed by a Capital Levy;
whilst, on the other hand, the <em>entrepreneur</em> class
must obviously prefer Depreciation which does not
hit them very much and may actually enrich them.
It is the combination of these two forces which will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
generally bring it about that a country will prefer
the inequitable and disastrous courses of Currency
Depreciation to the scientific deliberation of a Levy.</p>

<p>There is a respectable and influential body of
opinion which, repudiating with vehemence the adoption
of either expedient, fulminates alike against
Devaluations and Levies, on the ground that they
infringe the untouchable sacredness of contract; or
rather of vested interest, for an alteration of the legal
tender and the imposition of a tax on property are
neither of them in the least illegal or even contrary to
precedent. Yet such persons, by overlooking one of
the greatest of all social principles, namely the fundamental
distinction between the right of the individual
to repudiate contract and the right of the State to
control vested interest, are the worst enemies of what
they seek to preserve. For nothing can preserve the
integrity of contract between individuals, except a discretionary
authority in the State to revise what has
become intolerable. The powers of uninterrupted
usury are too great. If the accretions of vested
interest were to grow without mitigation for many
generations, half the population would be no better
than slaves to the other half. Nor can the fact that
in time of war it is easier for the State to borrow than
to tax, be allowed permanently to enslave the taxpayer
to the bond-holder. Those who insist that in
these matters the State is in exactly the same position
as the individual, will, if they have their way, render<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
impossible the continuance of an individualist society,
which depends for its existence on moderation.</p>

<p>These conclusions might be deemed obvious if
experience did not show that many conservative
bankers regard it as more consonant with their cloth,
and also as economising thought, to shift public
discussion of financial topics off the logical on to an
alleged “moral” plane, which means a realm of
thought where vested interest can be triumphant
over the common good without further debate.
But it makes them untrustworthy guides in a
perilous age of transition. The State must never
neglect the importance of so acting in ordinary
matters as to promote certainty and security in
business. But when great decisions are to be made,
the State is a sovereign body of which the purpose
is to promote the greatest good of the whole. When,
therefore, we enter the realm of State action, <em>everything</em>
is to be considered and weighed on its merits.
Changes in Death Duties, Income Tax, Land Tenure,
Licensing, Game Laws, Church Establishment, Feudal
Rights, Slavery, and so on through all ages, have
received the same denunciations from the absolutists
of contract,—who are the real parents of Revolution.</p>

<p>In our own country the question of the Capital
Levy depends for its answer on whether the great
increase in the claims of the bond-holder, arising out
of the fact that it was easier, and perhaps more
expedient, to raise a large part of the current costs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
the war by loans rather than by taxes, is more than
the taxpayer can be required, in the long run, to
support. The high levels of the Death Duties and of
the income- and super-taxes on unearned income, by
which the net return to the bond-holder is substantially
diminished,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">17</a> modify the case. Nevertheless,
immediately after the war, when it seemed that
the normal budget could scarcely be balanced without
a level of taxation of which a tax on earned income
at a standard rate between 6s. and 10s. in the £ would
be typical, a levy seemed to be necessary. At the
present time the case is rather more doubtful. It is
not yet possible to know how the normal budget will
work out, and much depends on the level at which
sterling prices are stabilised. If the level of sterling
prices is materially lowered, whether in pursuance of
a policy of restoring the old gold parity or for any
other reason, a levy may be required. If, however,
sterling prices are stabilised somewhere between
80 and 100 per cent above the pre-war level—a
settlement probably desirable on other grounds—and
if the progressive prosperity of the country is
restored, then perhaps we may balance our future
budgets without oppressive taxation on earned income
and without a levy either. A levy is from the practical
view perfectly feasible, and is not open to more
objection than any other <em>new</em> tax of like magnitude.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Nevertheless, like all new taxes, it cannot be brought
in without friction, and is, therefore, scarcely worth
advocating for its own sake merely in substitution
for an existing tax of similar incidence. It is to be
regarded as the fairest and most expedient method of
adjusting the burden of taxation between past accumulations
and the fruits of present efforts, whenever, in
the general judgment of the country, the discouragement
to the latter is excessive. A levy is to be
judged, not by itself, but as against the practicable
alternatives. Experience shows with great certainty
that the active part of the community will not
submit in the long run to pay too much to vested
interest, and, if the necessary adjustment is not made
in one way, it will be made in another,—probably by
the depreciation of the currency.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">17</a> The net return to the French <em>rentier</em> is more than 6 per cent; to the
British not much above 3 per cent.</p>

</div>

<p>In several countries the existing burden of the
internal debt renders Devaluation inevitable and
certain sooner or later. It will be sufficient to illustrate
the case by reference to the situation of France,—the
home of absolutism of all kinds, and hence,
sooner or later, of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bouleversement</i>. The finances of
Humpty Dumpty are as follows:</p>

<p>At the end of 1922 the internal debt of France,
excluding altogether her external debt, exceeded
250 milliard francs. Further borrowing budgeted for
in the ensuing period, together with loans on reconstruction
account guaranteed by the Government,
may bring this total to the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
of 300 milliards by the end of 1923. The
service of this debt will absorb nearly 18 milliards
per annum. The total normal receipts under the
provisional<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">18</a> Budget for 1923 are estimated at
round 23 milliards. That is to say, the service
of the debt will shortly absorb, at the value of
the franc current early in 1923, almost the entire
yield of taxation. Since other Government expenditure
in the ordinary budget (<i>i.e.</i>, excluding
war pensions and future expenditure on reconstruction)
cannot be put below 12 milliards a year, it
follows that, even on the improbable hypothesis that
further expenditure in the extraordinary budget after
1923 will be paid for by Germany, the yield of taxation
must be increased permanently by 30 per cent
to make both ends meet. If, however, the franc were
to depreciate to (say) 100 to the pound sterling, the
ordinary budget could be balanced by taking little
more of the real income of the country than in 1922.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">18</a> The forecasts of the final outcome of the year are frequently changed
and may be somewhat different from the above,—though not sufficiently
to affect the argument. M. de Lasteyrie has lately pointed out with pride
how the further depreciation of the franc, since he first introduced his
budget, is already improving the receipts measured in terms of francs.</p>

</div>

<p>In these circumstances it will be difficult, if
not impossible, to avoid the subtle assistance of a
further depreciation. What, then, is to be said of
those who still discuss seriously the project of restoring
the franc to its former parity? In such an event
the already intolerable burden of the <em>rentier’s</em> claims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
would be about trebled. It is unthinkable that
the French taxpayer would submit. Even if the
franc were put back to par by a miracle, it could not
stay there. Fresh inflation due to the inadequacy
of tax receipts must drive it anew on its downward
course. Yet I have assumed the cancellation of the
whole of France’s external debt, and the assumption
by Germany of the burdens of the extraordinary
budget after 1923, an assumption which is not
justified by present expectations. These facts alone
render it certain that the franc cannot be restored
to its former value.</p>

<p>France must come in due course to some compromise
between increasing taxation, and diminishing
expenditure, and reducing what they owe their
<em>rentiers</em>. I have not much doubt that the French
public, as they have hitherto, will consider a further
dose of depreciation—attributing it to the “bad
will” of Germany or to financial Machiavellism in
London and New York—as far more conservative,
orthodox, and in the interest of small savers, than
a justly constructed Capital Levy, the odium of
which could be less easily escaped by the French
Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p>If we look ahead, averting our eyes from the ups
and downs which can make and unmake fortunes in
the meantime, the level of the franc is going to be
settled in the long run not by speculation or the
balance of trade, or even the outcome of the Ruhr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
adventure, but by the proportion of his earned
income which the French taxpayer will permit to
be taken from him to pay the claims of the French
<em>rentier</em>. The level of the franc exchange will continue
to fall until the commodity-value of the francs
due to the <em>rentier</em> has fallen to a proportion of the
national income, which accords with the habits and
mentality of the country.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE THEORY OF MONEY AND OF THE
FOREIGN EXCHANGES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> evil consequences of instability in the standard
of value have now been sufficiently described. In
this chapter<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">19</a> we must lay the theoretical foundations
for the practical suggestions of the concluding
chapters. Most academic treatises on monetary
theory have been based, until lately, on so firm a
presumption of a gold standard régime that they
need to be adapted to the existing régime of mutually
inconvertible paper standards.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">19</a> Parts of this chapter raise, unavoidably, matters of much greater
difficulty to the layman than the rest of the book. The reader whose
interest in the theoretical foundations is secondary can pass on.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="sec_8">I. <i>The Quantity Theory of Money</i></h3>

<p>This Theory is fundamental. Its correspondence
with fact is not open to question.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">20</a> Nevertheless it
is often misstated and misrepresented. Goschen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
saying of sixty years ago, that “there are many
persons who cannot hear the relation of the level
of prices to the volume of currency affirmed without
a feeling akin to irritation,” still holds good.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="fnanchor">20</a> “The Quantity Theory is often defended and opposed as though it
were a definite set of propositions that must be either true or false. But
in fact the formulæ employed in the exposition of that theory are merely
devices for enabling us to bring together in an orderly way the principal
causes by which the value of money is determined” (Pigou).</p>

</div>

<p>The Theory flows from the fact that money as
such has no utility except what is derived from its
exchange-value, that is to say from the utility of the
things which it can buy. Valuable articles other than
money have a utility in themselves. Provided that
they are divisible and transferable, the total amount
of this utility increases with their quantity;—it will
not increase in full proportion to the quantity, but,
up to the point of satiety, it does increase.</p>

<p>If an article is used for money, such as gold,
which has a utility in itself for other purposes, aside
from its use as money, the strict statement of the
theory, though fundamentally unchanged, is a little
complicated. In present circumstances we can excuse
ourselves this complication. A Currency Note has
no utility in itself and is completely worthless except
for the purchasing power which it has as money.</p>

<p>Consequently what the public want is not so many
ounces or so many square yards or even so many £
sterling of currency notes, but a quantity sufficient
to cover a week’s wages, or to pay their bills, or to
meet their probable outgoings on a journey or a day’s
shopping. When people find themselves with more
cash than they require for such purposes, they get
rid of the surplus by buying goods or investments, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
by leaving it for a bank to employ, or, possibly, by
increasing their hoarded reserves. Thus the <em>number</em>
of notes which the public ordinarily have on hand
is determined by the amount of <em>purchasing power</em>
which it suits them to hold or to carry about, and by
nothing else. The amount of this purchasing power
depends partly on their wealth, partly on their habits.
The wealth of the public in the aggregate will only
change gradually. Their habits in the use of money—whether
their income is paid them weekly or
monthly or quarterly, whether they pay cash at
shops or run accounts, whether they deposit with
banks, whether they cash small cheques at short
intervals or larger cheques at longer intervals, whether
they keep a reserve or hoard of money about the
house—are more easily altered. But if their wealth
and their habits in the above respects are unchanged,
then the amount of purchasing power which they
hold in the form of money is definitely fixed. We
can measure this definite amount of purchasing power
in terms of a unit made up of a collection of specified
quantities of their standard articles of consumption
or other objects of expenditure; for example, the
kinds and quantities of articles which are combined
for the purpose of a cost-of-living index number.
Let us call such a unit a “consumption unit” and
assume that the public require to hold an amount
of money having a purchasing power over <i>k</i> consumption
units. Let there be <i>n</i> currency notes or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
other forms of cash in circulation with the public,
and let <i>p</i> be the price of each consumption unit (<i>i.e.</i>
<i>p</i> is the index number of the cost of living), then it
follows from the above that <i>n = pk</i>. This is the
famous Quantity Theory of Money. So long as <i>k</i>
remains unchanged, <i>n</i> and <i>p</i> rise and fall together;
that is to say, the greater or the fewer the number
of currency notes, the higher or the lower is the
price level in the same proportion.</p>

<p>So far we have assumed that the whole of the
public requirement for purchasing power is satisfied
by cash, and on the other hand that this requirement
is the only source of demand for cash; neglecting the
fact that the public, including the business world,
employ for the same purpose bank deposits and overdraft
facilities, whilst the banks must for the same
reason maintain a reserve of cash. The theory is
easily extended, however, to cover this case. Let us
assume that the public, including the business world,
find it convenient to keep the equivalent of <i>k</i> consumption
units in cash and of a further <i>k´</i> available
at their banks against cheques, and that the banks
keep in cash a proportion <i>r</i> of their potential liabilities
(<i>k´</i>) to the public. Our equation then becomes</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center"><i>n = p(k + rk´)</i>.</p>

<p class="in0">So long as <i>k</i>, <i>k´</i>, and <i>r</i> remain unchanged, we have the
same result as before, namely, that <i>n</i> and <i>p</i> rise and
fall together. The proportion between <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
depends on the banking arrangements of the public;
the absolute value of these on their habits generally;
and the value of <i>r</i> on the reserve practices of the banks.
Thus, so long as these are unaltered, we still have a
direct relation between the <em>quantity</em> of cash (<i>n</i>) and
the level of prices (<i>p</i>).<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="fnanchor">21</a> My exposition follows the general lines of Prof. Pigou (<cite>Quarterly
Journal of Economics</cite>, Nov. 1917) and of Dr. Marshall (<cite>Money, Credit, and
Commerce</cite>, I. iv.), rather than the perhaps more familiar analysis of Prof.
Irving Fisher. Instead of starting with the amount of cash held by the
public, Prof. Fisher begins with the volume of business transacted by means
of money and the frequency with which each unit of money changes hands.
It comes to the same thing in the end and it is easy to pass from the above
formula to Prof. Fisher’s; but the above method of approach seems less
artificial than Prof. Fisher’s and nearer to the observed facts.</p>

</div>

<p>We have seen that the amount of <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i> depends
partly on the wealth of the community, partly on its
habits. Its habits are fixed by its estimation of the
extra convenience of having more cash in hand as
compared with the advantages to be got from spending
the cash or investing it. The point of equilibrium
is reached where the estimated advantages of keeping
more cash in hand compared with those of spending
or investing it about balance. The matter cannot be
summed up better than in the words of Dr. Marshall:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In every state of society there is some fraction of their
income which people find it worth while to keep in the form
of currency; it may be a fifth, or a tenth, or a twentieth. A
large command of resources in the form of currency renders
their business easy and smooth, and puts them at an advantage
in bargaining; but on the other hand it locks up in a
barren form resources that might yield an income of gratification
if invested, say, in extra furniture; or a money
income, if invested in extra machinery or cattle.” A man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
fixes the appropriate fraction “after balancing one against
another the advantages of a further ready command, and
the disadvantages of putting more of his resources into a
form in which they yield him no direct income or other
benefit.” “Let us suppose that the inhabitants of a country,
taken one with another (and including therefore all varieties
of character and of occupation), find it just worth their
while to keep by them on the average ready purchasing
power to the extent of a tenth part of their annual income,
together with a fiftieth part of their property; then the
aggregate value of the currency of the country will tend to
be equal to the sum of these amounts.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="fnanchor">22</a> <cite>Money, Credit, and Commerce</cite>, I. iv. 3. Dr. Marshall shows in a footnote
as follows that the above is in fact a development of the traditional
way of considering the matter: “Petty thought that the money ‘sufficient
for’ the nation is ‘so much as will pay half a year’s rent for all the lands
of England and a quarter’s rent of the Houseing, for a week’s expense of
all the people, and about a quarter of the value of all the exported commodities.’
Locke estimated that ‘one-fiftieth of wages and one-fourth
of the landowner’s income and one-twentieth part of the broker’s yearly
returns in ready money will be enough to drive the trade of any country.’
Cantillon (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1755), after a long and subtle study, concludes that the
value needed is a ninth of the total produce of the country; or, what he
takes to be the same thing, a third of the rent of the land. Adam Smith
has more of the scepticism of the modern age and says: ‘it is impossible
to determine the proportion,’ though ‘it has been computed by different
authors at a fifth, at a tenth, at a twentieth, and at a thirtieth part of the
whole value of the annual produce.’” In modern conditions the normal
proportion of the circulation to this national income seems to be somewhere
between a tenth and a fifteenth.</p>

</div>

<p>So far there should be no room for difference of
opinion. The error often made by careless adherents
of the Quantity Theory, which may partly explain
why it is not universally accepted, is as follows.</p>

<p>Every one admits that the habits of the public in
the use of money and of banking facilities and the
practices of the banks in respect of their reserves
change from time to time as the result of obvious
developments. These habits and practices are a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
reflection of changes in economic and social organisation.
But the Theory has often been expounded on
the further assumption that a <em>mere</em> change in the
quantity of the currency cannot affect <i>k</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>k´</i>,—that
is to say, in mathematical parlance, that <i>n</i> is an
<em>independent variable</em> in relation to these quantities.
It would follow from this that an arbitrary doubling
of <i>n</i>, since this in itself is assumed not to affect
<i>k</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>k´</i>, must have the effect of raising <i>p</i> to double
what it would have been otherwise. The Quantity
Theory is often stated in this, or a similar, form.</p>

<p>Now “in the long run” this is probably true.
If, after the American Civil War, the American
dollar had been stabilised and defined by law at
10 per cent below its present value, it would be safe
to assume that <i>n</i> and <i>p</i> would now be just 10 per cent
greater than they actually are and that the present
values of <i>k</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>k´</i> would be entirely unaffected.
But this <em>long run</em> is a misleading guide to current
affairs. <em>In the long run</em> we are all dead. Economists
set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in
tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when
the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.</p>

<p>In actual experience, a change of n is liable to
have a reaction both on <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i> and on <i>r</i>. It will
be enough to give a few typical instances. Before
the war (and indeed since) there was a considerable
element of what was conventional and arbitrary in
the reserve policy of the banks, but especially in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
policy of the State Banks towards their gold reserves.
These reserves were kept for show rather than for
use, and their amount was not the result of close
reasoning. There was a decided tendency on the part
of these banks between 1900 and 1914 to bottle up gold
when it flowed towards them and to part with it
reluctantly when the tide was flowing the other way.
Consequently, when gold became relatively abundant
they tended to hoard what came their way and to
raise the proportion of the reserves, with the result
that the increased output of South African gold was
absorbed with less effect on the price level than would
have been the case if an increase of <i>n</i> had been totally
without reaction on the value of <i>r</i>.</p>

<p>In agricultural countries where peasants readily
hoard money, an inflation, especially in its early
stages, does not raise prices proportionately, because
when, as a result of a certain rise in the price of agricultural
products, more money flows into the pockets
of the peasants, it tends to stick there;—deeming
themselves that much richer, the peasants increase
the proportion of their receipts that they hoard.</p>

<p>Thus in these and in other ways the terms of our
equation tend in their movements to favour the
stability of <i>p</i>, and there is a certain friction which
prevents a moderate change in <i>n</i> from exercising its
full proportionate effect on <i>p</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand a large change in <i>n</i>, which
rubs away the initial friction, and especially a change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
in <i>n</i> due to causes which set up a general expectation
of a further change in the same direction, may produce
a <em>more</em> than proportionate effect on <i>p</i>. After the
general analysis of Chapter I. and the narratives
of catastrophic inflations given in Chapter II., it is
scarcely necessary to illustrate this further,—it is a
matter more readily understood than it was ten
years ago. A large change in <i>p</i> greatly affects
individual fortunes. Hence a change after it has
occurred, or sooner in so far as it is anticipated, may
greatly affect the monetary habits of the public in
their attempt to protect themselves from a similar
loss in future, or to make gains and avoid loss during
the passage from the equilibrium corresponding to
the old value of <i>n</i> to the equilibrium corresponding
to its new value. Thus after, during, and (so far
as the change is anticipated) before a change in the
value of <i>n</i>, there will be some reaction on the values
of <i>k</i>, <i>k´</i>, and <i>r</i>, with the result that the change in the
value of <i>p</i>, at least temporarily and perhaps permanently
(since habits and practices, once changed,
will not revert to exactly their old shape), will not be
precisely in proportion to the change in <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>The terms <em>inflation</em> and <em>deflation</em> are used by
different writers in varying senses. It would be convenient
to speak of an increase or decrease in <i>n</i> as
an inflation or deflation of <em>cash</em>; and of a decrease
or increase in <i>r</i> as an inflation or deflation of <em>credit</em>.
The characteristic of the “credit-cycle” (as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
alternation of boom and depression is now described)
consists in a tendency of <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i> to diminish during
the boom and increase during the depression, irrespective
of changes in <i>n</i> and <i>r</i>, these movements representing
respectively a diminution and an increase of
“real” balances (<i>i.e.</i> balances, in hand or at the
bank, measured in terms of purchasing power); so
that we might call this phenomenon deflation and
inflation of real balances.</p>

<p>It will illustrate the “Quantity Theory” equation
in general and the phenomena of deflation and
inflation of real balances in particular, if we endeavour
to fill in actual values for our symbolic quantities.
The following example does not claim to be exact and
its object is to illustrate the idea rather than to
convey statistically precise facts. October 1920 was
about the end of the recent boom, and October 1922
was near the bottom of the depression. At these two
dates the figures of price level (taking October 1922
as 100), cash circulation (note circulation <em>plus</em> private
deposits at the Bank of England<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">23</a>), and bank deposits
in Great Britain were roughly as follows:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="fnanchor">23</a> It would take me too far from the immediate matter in hand to
discuss why I take this definition of “cash” in the case of Great Britain.
It is discussed further in Chapter V. below.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0">Thus during the depression <i>k</i> rose from 230 to 300
and <i>k´</i> from 1333 to 1700, which means that the cash
holdings of the public at the former date were worth
23/30, and their bank balances 1333/1700, what they were
worth at the latter date. It thus appears that the
tendency of <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i> to increase had more to do, than
the deflation of “cash” had, with the fall of prices
between the two periods. If <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i> were to fall back
to their 1920 values, prices would rise 30 per cent
without any change whatever in the volume of cash or
the reserve policy of the banks. Thus even in Great
Britain the fluctuations of <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i> can have a decisive
influence on the price level; whilst we have already
seen (pp. 51, 52) how enormously they can change in
the recent conditions of Russia and Central Europe.</p>

<p>The moral of this discussion, to be carried forward
in the reader’s mind until we reach Chapters IV. and
V., is that the price level is not mysterious, but is
governed by a few, definite, analysable influences.
Two of these, <i>n</i> and <i>r</i>, are under the direct control (or
ought to be) of the central banking authorities. The
third, namely <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i>, is not directly controllable, and
depends on the mood of the public and the business
world. The business of stabilising the price level,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
not merely over long periods but so as also to avoid
cyclical fluctuations, consists partly in exercising a
stabilising influence over <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i>, in so far as
this fails or is impracticable, in deliberately varying <i>n</i>
and <i>r</i> so as to <em>counterbalance</em> the movement of <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i>.</p>

<p>The usual method of exercising a stabilising influence
over <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i> especially over <i>k´</i>, is that of
bank-rate. A tendency of <i>k´</i> to increase may be
somewhat counteracted by lowering the bank-rate,
because easy lending diminishes the advantage of
keeping a margin for contingencies in cash. Cheap
money also operates to <em>counterbalance</em> an increase of
<i>k´</i>, because, by encouraging borrowing from the banks,
it prevents <i>r</i> from increasing or causes <i>r</i> to diminish.
But it is doubtful whether bank-rate by itself is
always a powerful enough instrument, and, if we are
to achieve stability, we must be prepared to vary <i>n</i>
and <i>r</i> on occasion.</p>

<p>Our analysis suggests that the first duty of the
central banking and currency authorities is to make
sure that they have <i>n</i> and <i>r</i> thoroughly under control.
For example, so long as inflationary taxation is in
question <i>n</i> will be influenced by other than currency
objects and cannot, therefore, be fully under control;
moreover, at the other extreme, under a gold standard
<i>n</i> is not always under control, because it depends on
the unregulated forces which determine the demand
and supply of gold throughout the world. Again,
without a central banking system <i>r</i> will not be under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
proper control because it will be determined by the
unco-ordinated decisions of numerous different banks.</p>

<p>At the present time in Great Britain <i>r</i> is very
completely controlled, and <i>n</i> also, so long as we
refrain from inflationary finance on the one hand and
from a return to an unregulated gold standard on the
other.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">25</a> The second duty of the authorities is therefore
worth discussing, namely, the <em>use</em> of their control
over <i>n</i> and <i>r</i> to counterbalance changes in <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i>.
Even if <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i> were entirely outside the influence of
deliberate policy, which is not in fact the case,
nevertheless <i>p</i> could be kept reasonably steady by
suitable modifications of the values of <i>n</i> and <i>r</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="fnanchor">25</a> In the case of the United States the same thing is more or less true,
so long as the Federal Reserve Board is prepared to incur the expense of
bottling up redundant gold.</p>

</div>

<p>Old-fashioned advocates of sound money have laid
too much emphasis on the need of keeping <i>n</i> and <i>r</i>
steady, and have argued as if this policy by itself
would produce the right results. So far from this
being so, steadiness of <i>n</i> and <i>r</i>, when <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i> are not
steady, is bound to lead to unsteadiness of the price
level. Cyclical fluctuations are characterised, not
primarily by changes in <i>n</i> or <i>r</i>, but by changes in <i>k</i>
and <i>k´</i>. It follows that they can only be cured if
we are ready deliberately to increase and decrease <i>n</i>
and <i>r</i>, when symptoms of movement are showing in
the values of <i>k</i> and <i>k´</i>. I am being led, however,
into a large subject beyond my immediate purpose,
and am anticipating also the topic of Chapter V.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
These hints will serve, nevertheless, to indicate to
the reader what a long way we may be led by an
understanding of the implications of the simple
Quantity equation with which we started.</p>

<h3 id="sec_9">II. <i>The Theory of Purchasing Power Parity.</i></h3>

<p>The Quantity Theory deals with the purchasing
power or commodity-value of a given national
currency. We come now to the <em>relative</em> value of <em>two</em>
distinct national currencies,—that is to say, to the
theory of the Foreign Exchanges.</p>

<p>When the currencies of the world were nearly all
on a gold basis, their relative value (<i>i.e.</i> the exchanges)
depended on the actual amount of gold metal in a
unit of each, with minor adjustments for the cost of
transferring the metal from place to place.</p>

<p>When this common measure has ceased to be
effective and we have instead a number of independent
systems of inconvertible paper, what basic fact
determines the rates at which units of the different
currencies exchange for one another?</p>

<p>The explanation is to be found in the doctrine, as
old in itself as Ricardo, with which Professor Cassel
has lately familiarised the public under the name of
“Purchasing Power Parity.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="fnanchor">26</a> This term was first introduced into economic literature in an article
contributed by Prof. Cassel to the <cite>Economic Journal</cite>, December 1918. For
Prof. Cassel’s considered opinions on the whole question, see his <cite>Money and
Foreign Exchange after 1914</cite> (1922). The theory, as distinct from the name,
is essentially Ricardo’s.</p>

</div>

<p>This doctrine in its baldest form runs as follows:
(1) The purchasing power of an inconvertible currency
within its own country, <i>i.e.</i> the currency’s <em>internal</em>
purchasing power, depends on the currency policy of
the Government and the currency habits of the people,
in accordance with the Quantity Theory of Money
just discussed. (2) The purchasing power of an
inconvertible currency in a foreign country, <i>i.e.</i> the
currency’s <em>external</em> purchasing power, must be the
rate of exchange between the home-currency and the
foreign-currency, multiplied by the foreign-currency’s
purchasing power in its own country. (3) In conditions
of equilibrium the <em>internal</em> and <em>external</em> purchasing
powers of a currency must be the <em>same</em>, allowance
being made for transport charges and import and export
taxes; for otherwise a movement of trade would
occur in order to take advantage of the inequality.
(4) It follows, therefore, from (1), (2), and (3) that
the rate of exchange between the home-currency and
the foreign-currency must tend in equilibrium to be
the ratio between the purchasing powers of the home-currency
at home and of the foreign-currency in the
foreign country. This ratio between the respective
home purchasing powers of the two currencies is
designated their “purchasing power parity.”</p>

<p>If, therefore, we find that the internal and external
purchasing powers of the home-currency are widely
different, and, which is the same thing, that the
actual exchange rates differ widely from the purchasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
power parities, then we are justified in inferring
that equilibrium is not established, and that, as time
goes on, forces will come into play to bring the actual
exchange rates and the purchasing power parities
nearer together. The actual exchanges are often
more sensitive and more volatile than the purchasing
power parities, being subject to speculation, to sudden
movements of funds, to seasonal influences, and to
<em>anticipations</em> of impending changes in purchasing
power parity (due to relative inflation or deflation);
though also on other occasions they may lag behind.
Nevertheless it is the purchasing power parity,
according to this doctrine, which corresponds to the
old gold par. This is the point about which the
exchanges fluctuate, and at which they must ultimately
come to rest; with one material difference,
namely, that it is not itself a fixed point,—since, if
internal prices move differently in the two countries
under comparison, the purchasing power parity also
moves, so that equilibrium may be restored, not only
by a movement in the market rate of exchange, but also
by a movement of the purchasing power parity itself.</p>

<p>At first sight this theory appears to be one of great
practical utility; and many persons have endeavoured
to draw important practical conclusions about the
future course of the exchanges from charts exhibiting
the divergences between the market rate of exchange
and the purchasing power parities,—undeterred by
the perplexity whether an existing divergence from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
equilibrium will be remedied by a movement of the
exchanges or of the purchasing power parity or of both.</p>

<p>In practical applications of the doctrine there are,
however, two further difficulties, which we have
allowed so far to escape our attention,—both of them
arising out of the words <em>allowance being made for
transport charges and import and export taxes</em>. The
first difficulty is how to make allowance for such
charges and taxes. The second difficulty is how to
treat purchasing power over goods and services which
<em>do not enter into international trade at all</em>.</p>

<p>The doctrine, in the form in which it is generally
applied, endeavours to deal with the first difficulty
by assuming that the percentage difference between
internal and external purchasing power at some
standard date, when approximate equilibrium may
be presumed to have existed, generally the year 1913,
may be taken as an approximately satisfactory
correction for the same disturbing factors at the
present time. For example, instead of calculating
directly the cost of a standard set of goods at home
and abroad respectively, the calculations are made
that $2 are required to buy in the United States a
standard set which $1 would have bought in 1913,
and that £2·43 are required to buy in England what
£1 would have bought in 1913. On this basis (the
pre-war purchasing power parity being assumed to
be in equilibrium with the pre-war exchange of
$4·86 = £1) the present purchasing power parity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
between dollars and sterling is given by $4 = £1, since
4·86 × 2 ÷ 2·43 = 4.</p>

<p>The obvious objection to this method of correction
is that transport and tariff costs, especially
if this term is taken to cover all export and import
regulations, including prohibitions and official or
semi-official combines for differentiating between
export and home prices, are notoriously widely
different in many cases from those which existed
in 1913. We should not get the same result if we
were to take some year other than 1913 as the basis
of the calculation.</p>

<p>The second difficulty—the treatment of purchasing
power over articles which do not enter into international
trade—is still more serious. For, if we
restrict ourselves to articles entering into international
trade and make exact allowance for transport and
tariff costs, we should find that the theory is always
in accordance with the facts, with perhaps a short
time-lag, the purchasing power parity being never
very far from the market rate of exchange. Indeed,
it is the whole business of the international merchant
to see that this is so; for whenever the rates are
temporarily out of parity he is in a position to make
a profit by moving goods. The prices of cotton in
New York, Liverpool, Havre, Hamburg, Genoa, and
Prague, expressed in dollars, sterling, francs, marks,
lire, and krone respectively, are never for any length
of time much divergent from one another on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
basis of the exchange rates actually obtaining in the
market, due allowance being made for tariffs and the
cost of moving cotton from one centre to another;
and the same is true of other articles of international
trade, though with an increasing time-lag as we pass
to articles which are not standardised or are not
handled in organised markets. In fact, the theory,
stated thus, is a truism, and as nearly as possible
jejune.</p>

<p>For this reason practical applications of the theory
are not thus restricted. The standard set of commodities
selected is not confined to goods which are
exported from and imported into the countries under
comparison, but is the same set, generally speaking,
as is used for compiling index numbers of general
purchasing power or of the working-class cost of
living. Yet applied in this way—namely, in a comparison
of movements of the <em>general</em> index numbers
of home prices in two countries with movements
in the rates of exchange between their currencies—the
theory requires a further assumption for its
validity, namely, that in the long run the home
prices of the goods and services which do not enter
into international trade, move in more or less the
same proportions as those which do.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="fnanchor">27</a> “Our calculation of the purchasing power parity rests strictly on the
proviso that the rise in prices in the countries concerned has affected all
commodities in a like degree. If that proviso is not fulfilled, then the actual
exchange rate may deviate from the calculated purchasing power parity.”
Cassel, <cite>Money and Foreign Exchange after 1914</cite>, p. 154.</p>

</div>

<p>So far from this being a truism, it is not literally or
exactly true at all; and one can only say that it is
more or less true according to circumstances. If
capital and labour can freely move on a large scale
between home and export industries without loss of
relative efficiency, if there is no movement in the
“equation of exchange” (see below) with the other
country, and if the fluctuations in price are solely
due to monetary influences and not to changes in
other economic relationships between the two countries,
then this further assumption may be approximately
justified. But this is not always the case; and such
a cataclysm as the war, with its various consequences
to victor and vanquished, may set up a new equilibrium
position. There may, for example, be a change
more or less permanent, or at least as prolonged as the
reparation payments, in the relative exchange values
of Germany’s imports and exports respectively, or of
those German products and services which can enter
into international trade and those which cannot. Or,
again, the strengthening of the financial position of
the United States as against Europe, which has
resulted from the war, may have shifted the old
equilibrium in a direction favourable to the United
States. In such cases it is not correct to assume that
the coefficients of purchasing power parity, calculated,
as they generally are calculated, by means of the
relative variations of index numbers of general purchasing
power from their pre-war levels, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
ultimately approximate to the actual rates of exchange,
or that internal and external purchasing power must
ultimately bear to one another the same relation as
in 1913.</p>

<p>The Index Number calculated for the United
States by the Federal Reserve Board illustrates how
disturbing may be the influence of the change since
1913 in the relative prices of imported goods, exported
goods, and commodities generally:</p>

<p>Thus the theory does not provide a simple or
ready-made measure of the “true” value of the exchanges.
When it is restricted to foreign-trade goods,
it is little better than a truism. When it is not so
restricted, the conception of purchasing power parity
becomes much more interesting, but is no longer an
accurate forecaster of the course of the foreign
exchanges. If, therefore, we follow the ordinary
practice of fixing purchasing power parity by comparisons
of the <em>general</em> purchasing power of a country’s
currency at home and abroad, then we must not infer
from this that the actual rate of exchange <em>ought</em> to
stand at the purchasing power parity, or that it is
only a matter of time and adjustment before the two
will return to equality. Purchasing power parity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
thus defined, tells us an important fact about the
relative changes in the purchasing power of money
in (<i>e.g.</i>) England and the United States or Germany
between 1913 and, say, 1923, but it does not
necessarily settle what the equilibrium exchange
rate in 1923 between sterling and dollars or marks
ought to be.</p>

<p>Thus defined “purchasing power parity” deserves
attention, even though it is not always an accurate
forecaster of the foreign exchanges. The practical
importance of our qualifications must not be exaggerated.
If the fluctuations of purchasing power
parity are markedly different from the fluctuations in
the exchanges, this indicates an actual or impending
change in the relative prices of the two classes of goods
which respectively do and do not enter into international
trade. Now there is certainly a tendency
for movements in the prices of these two classes of
goods to influence one another in the long run. The
relative valuation placed on them is derived from
deep economic and psychological causes which are
not easily disturbed. If, therefore, the divergence
from the pre-existing equilibrium is mainly due to
monetary causes (as, for example, different degrees
of inflation or deflation in the two countries), as it
often is, then we may reasonably expect that purchasing
power parity and exchange value will come
together again before long.</p>

<p>When this is the case, it is not possible to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
in general whether exchange value will move towards
purchasing power parity or the other way
round. Sometimes, as recently in Europe, it is the
exchanges which are the more sensitive to impending
relative price-changes and move first; whilst in
other cases the exchanges may not move until after
the change in the relation between the internal
and external price-levels is an accomplished fact.
But the essence of the purchasing power parity
theory, considered as an explanation of the exchanges,
is to be found, I think, in its regarding
internal purchasing power as being in the long run
a more trustworthy indicator of a currency’s value
than the market rates of exchange, because internal
purchasing power quickly reflects the monetary policy
of the country, which is the final determinant. If the
market rates of exchange fall further than the country’s
existing or impending currency policy justifies by its
effect on the internal purchasing power of the country’s
money, then sooner or later the exchange value is
bound to recover. Thus, provided no persisting
change is taking place in the basic economic relations
between two countries, and provided the internal
purchasing power of the currency has in each country
settled down to equilibrium in relation to the currency
policy of the authorities, then the rate of exchange
between the currencies of the two countries must also
settle down in the long run to correspond with their
comparative internal purchasing powers. Subject to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
these assumptions comparative internal purchasing
power does take the place of the old gold parity as
furnishing the point about which the short-period
movements of the exchanges fluctuate.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, these assumptions are not
fulfilled and changes are taking place in the “equation
of exchange,” as economists call it, between the
services and products of one country and those of
another, either on account of movements of capital,
or reparation payments, or changes in the relative
efficiency of labour, or changes in the urgency of the
world’s demand for that country’s special products,
or the like, then the equilibrium point between purchasing
power parity and the rate of exchange may
be modified permanently.</p>

<p>This point may be made clearer by an example.
Let us consider two countries, Westropa and the
United States of the Hesperides, and let us assume
for the sake of simplicity, and also because it may
often correspond to the facts, that in both countries
the price of exported goods moves in the same way
as the price of other home-produced goods, but that
the “equation of exchange” has moved in favour
of the Hesperides so that a smaller number than
before of units of Hesperidean products exchange for
a given quantity of Westropean products. It follows
from this that imported products in Westropa will
rise in price more than commodities generally, whilst
in the Hesperides they will rise less. Let us suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
that between 1913 and 1923 the Westropean index
number of prices has risen from 100 to 155 and the
Hesperidean index number from 100 to 160; that
these index numbers are so constructed in each case
that imported commodities constitute 20 per cent
and home-produced commodities 80 per cent of the
whole; and that the “equation of exchange” has
moved 10 per cent in favour of the Hesperides, that
is to say a given quantity of the goods exported by
the Hesperides will buy 10 per cent more than before
of the goods exported by Europe. The state of affairs
is then as follows:<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p class="in0">Thus it appears that the purchasing power parity of
the Westropean currency in 1923 compared with 1913
is (160/155 = )103; whereas the rate of exchange, compared
with the 1913 parity, is (163/167 = 148/152 = )97. If
the worsening of Westropa’s equation of exchange
with the Hesperides is permanent, then its purchasing
power parity (on the 1913 basis) will also remain
permanently above the equilibrium value of the
market rate of exchange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>A tendency of these two measures of the value of
a country’s currency to move differently is, therefore,
a highly interesting symptom. If the market rate
of exchange shows a continuing tendency to stand
below the purchasing power parity, we have, failing
any other explanation, some reason to suspect a
worsening of the “equation of exchange” as compared
with the base year.</p>

<p>In the charts and tables below, the actual results
are worked out of applying the theory to the exchange
value of sterling, francs, and lire in terms of dollars
since 1919. The figures show that, quantitatively
speaking, the influences, which detract from the
precision of the purchasing power parity theory,
have been in these cases small, on the whole, as
compared with those which function in accord with
it. There seems to have been some disturbance in the
“equations of exchange” since 1913,—which would
probably show up more distinctly if it were not
that the index numbers employed in the following
enquiry are of the type which is largely built up from
articles entering into international trade. Nevertheless
general price changes, affecting all commodities
more or less equally, due to currency inflation or deflation,
have been so dominant in their influence that
the theory has been actually applicable with remarkable
accuracy. In the case, however, of such countries
as Germany, where the shocks to equilibrium have been
much more violent in many respects, the concordance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
between the purchasing power parity based on 1913
and the actual rate of exchange has suffered, whether
temporarily or permanently, very great disturbance.</p>

<p>The first of these charts, which deals with the
value of sterling in terms of dollars, shows that
whilst the purchasing power parity, calculated with
1913 as base, is often somewhat above the actual
exchange, there is a persevering tendency for the
two to come together. The two curves are within
one point of each other in September-November 1919,
March-April 1920, April 1921, September 1921,
January-June 1922, and February-June 1923, which
is certainly a remarkable illustration of the tendency
to concordance between the purchasing power parity
and the rate of exchange. On inductive grounds it
would be tempting to conclude from this chart that
the financial consequences of the war have depressed
the equilibrium of the purchasing power parity of
sterling as against the dollar from 1 to 2½ per cent
since 1913, if it were not that this figure barely
exceeds the margin of error resulting from the choice
of one pair of index numbers rather than another
from amongst those available.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">29</a> It will be interesting
to see what effect is produced by the payment, just
commenced, of the interest on the American debt.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="fnanchor">29</a> Nevertheless, if I had used the Board of Trade or the <cite>Statist</cite> index
number in place of the <cite>Economist</cite> index number in the table below, the
presumption of a slight worsening of the “equation of index” against
Great Britain would be somewhat strengthened.</p>

</div>

<p>This chart brings out clearly, as also do those for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
France and Italy, the susceptibility of the foreign
exchange rates to seasonal influences, whereas the purchasing
power parity is naturally less affected by them.</p>

<p>In the case of France the curves are together at
the end of 1919, diverge in 1920, come together again
in the middle of 1921, and keep together until a
divergence occurred again in the latter part of 1922.</p>

<p>For Italy, rather unexpectedly perhaps, the relationship
is extraordinarily steady, although here, as
in the case of France and Great Britain, there are
indications that the war may have resulted in a
slight lowering of the equilibrium point, by (say) 10
per cent;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">30</a>—the parity, calculated with 1913 as the
base year, has been almost invariably somewhat above
the actual rate of exchange. The Italian curve illustrates
in a remarkable way the manner in which the
external and internal purchasing powers of the currency
fall together, when the main influence at work is
a progressive depreciation due to currency inflation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="fnanchor">30</a> The use of any of the other Italian index numbers would have
accentuated this indication. The <a href="#t94">table</a> of American prices given on p. 94
above confirms the suggestion that the “equation of exchange” between
the U.S. and the rest of the world as a whole has moved, say, 10 per cent
in favour of the former.</p>

</div>

<p>The broad effect of these curves and tables is to
give substantial inductive support to the general theory
outlined above, even under such abnormal conditions
as have existed since the Armistice. During this
period the movements of the relative price level in
France and Italy due to monetary inflation have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
so much larger than any shifting in the “equation of
exchange” (a movement of more than 10 or 20 per
cent in which would be startling) that their foreign
exchanges have been much more influenced by their
internal price policy in relation to the internal price
policies of other countries than by any other factor;
with the result that the Purchasing Power Parity
Theory, even in its crude form, has worked passably
well.</p>

<h3 id="sec_10">III. <i>The Seasonal Fluctuation.</i></h3>

<p>Thus the Theory of Purchasing Power Parity tells
us that movements in the rate of exchange between
the currencies of two countries tend, subject to adjustment
in respect of movements in the “equation of
exchange,” to correspond pretty closely to movements
in the internal price levels of the two countries each
expressed in their own currency. It follows that the
rate of exchange can be improved in favour of one
of the countries by a financial policy directed towards
a lowering of its internal price level relatively to the
internal price level of the other country. On the
other hand a financial policy which has the effect of
raising the internal price level must result, sooner or
later, in depressing the rate of exchange.</p>

<p>The conclusion is generally drawn, and quite
correctly, that budgetary deficits covered by a progressive
inflation of the currency render the stabilisation
of a country’s exchanges impossible; and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
the cessation of any increase in the volume of currency,
due to this cause, is a necessary pre-requisite to a
successful attempt at stabilising.</p>

<p>The argument, however, is often carried further
than this, and it is supposed that, if a country’s
budget, currency, foreign trade, and its internal and
external price levels are properly adjusted, then,
automatically, its foreign exchange will be steady.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">36</a>
So long, therefore, as the exchanges fluctuate—thus
the argument runs—this in itself is a symptom that
an attempt to stabilise would be premature. When,
on the other hand, the basic conditions necessary
for stabilisation are present, the exchange will steady
itself. In short, any deliberate or artificial scheme
of stabilisation is attacking the problem at the wrong
end. It is the regulation of the currency, by means
of sound budgetary and bank-rate policies, that needs
attention. The proclamation of convertibility will
be the last and crowning stage of the proceedings,
and will amount to little more than the announcement
of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fait accompli</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="fnanchor">36</a> Dr. R. Estcourt, criticising one of my articles in <cite>The Annalist</cite> for June
12, 1922, writes: “The arrangement would not last for any appreciable
period unless, as a preliminary, the Governments took the necessary steps
to balance their budgets. If that were done, the so-called stabilisation
speedily would become unnecessary; exchange would stabilise itself at
pre-war rates.” This passage puts boldly an opinion which is widely held.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a certain force in this mode of reasoning.
But in one important respect it is fallacious.</p>

<p>Even though foreign trade is properly adjusted,
and the country’s claims and liabilities on foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
account are in equilibrium over the year as a whole,
it does not follow that they are in equilibrium every
day. Indeed, it is well known that countries which
import large quantities of agricultural produce do
not find it convenient, if they are to secure just the
quality and the amount which they require, to buy
at an equal rate throughout the year, but prefer to
concentrate their purchases on the autumn period.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">37</a>
Thus, quite consistently with equilibrium over the
year as a whole, industrial countries tend to owe
money to agricultural countries in the second half of
the year, and to repay in the first half. The satisfaction
of these seasonal requirements for credit with
the least possible disturbance to trade was recognised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
before the war as an important function of international
banking, and the seasonal transference of
short-term credits from one centre to another was
carried out for a moderate commission.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="fnanchor">37</a> Whilst the fact of seasonal pressure is well ascertained, the exact analysis
of it is a little complicated. Food arrivals into Great Britain, for example,
are nearly 10 per cent heavier in the third and fourth quarters of the year
than in the first and second, and reach their maximum in the fourth quarter.
(These and the following figures are based on averages for the pre-war period
1901–1913 worked out by the Cambridge and London Economic Service).
Raw material imports are more than 20 per cent heavier in the fourth and
first quarters than in the second and third, and reach their maximum in the
three months November to January. Thus the fourth quarter of the year
is the period at which there are heavy imports of both food and raw materials.
Manufactured exports, on the other hand, are distributed through the year
much more evenly, and are about normal during the last quarter. Allowing
for the fact that imports are paid for, generally speaking, before they arrive,
these dates correspond pretty closely with the date at which seasonal
pressure is actually experienced by the dollar-sterling exchange. In France,
since the war, imports in the last quarter of the year seem to have been quite
50 per cent heavier than, for example, in the first quarter. In Italy the
third quarter seems to be the slackest, and the last quarter, again, a relatively
heavy period. When we turn to the statistics for the United States we find
the other side of the picture. August and September are the months of
heavy wheat export; October to January those of heavy cotton export.
The strength of the dollar exchanges in the early autumn is further increased
by the financial pressure in the United States during the crop-moving period,
which leads to a withdrawal of funds from foreign centres to New York.</p>

<p>It was possible for this service to be rendered
cheaply because, with the certainty provided by
convertibility, the price paid for it did not need to
include any appreciable provision against risk. A
somewhat higher rate of discount in the temporarily
debtor country, together with a small exchange
profit provided by the slight shift of the exchanges
within the gold points, was quite sufficient.</p>

<p>But what is the position now? As always, the
balance of payments must balance every day. As
before, the balance of trade is spread unevenly
through the year. Formerly the daily balance was
adjusted by the movement of bankers’ funds, as
described above. But now it is no longer a purely
bankers’ business, suitably and sufficiently rewarded
by an arbitrage profit. If a banker moves credits
temporarily from one country to another, he cannot
be certain at what rate of exchange he will be able
to bring them back again later on. Even though
he may have a strong opinion as to the probable
course of exchange, his profit is no longer definitely
calculable beforehand, as it used to be; he has learnt
by experience that unforeseen movements of the
exchange may involve him in heavy loss; and his
prospective profit must be commensurate with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
risk he runs. Even if he thinks that the risk is
covered actuarially by the prospective profit, a banker
cannot afford to run such risks on a large scale. In
fact, the seasonal adjustment of credit requirements
has ceased to be arbitrage banking business, and
demands the services of speculative finance.</p>

<p>Under present conditions, therefore, a large fluctuation
of the exchange may be necessary before the
daily account can be balanced, even though the
annual account is level. Where in the old days
a banker would have readily remitted millions to
and from New York, hundreds of thousands are now
as much as the biggest institutions will risk. The
exchange must fall (or rise, as the case may be)
until either the speculative financier feels sufficiently
confident of a large profit to step in, or the merchant,
appalled by the rate of exchange quoted to him for
the transaction, decides to forgo the convenience
of purchasing at that particular season of the year,
and postpones a part of his purchases.</p>

<p>The services of the professional exchange speculator,
being discouraged by official and banking
influences, are generally in short supply, so that a
heavy price has to be paid for them, and trade is
handicapped by a corresponding expense, in so far
as it continues to purchase its materials at the most
convenient season of the year.</p>

<p>The extent to which the exchange fluctuations
which have troubled trade during the past three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
years have been seasonal, and therefore due, not to
a continuing or increasing disequilibrium, but merely
to the absence of a fixed exchange, is not, I think,
fully appreciated.</p>

<p>During 1919 there was a heavy fall of the chief
European exchanges due to the termination of the
inter-Allied arrangements which had existed during
the war. During 1922 there was a rise of the sterling
exchange, which was independent of seasonal influences.
During 1923 there has been a further non-seasonal
collapse of the franc exchange due to certain
persisting features of France’s internal finances and
external policy. But the following table shows how
largely <em>recurrent</em> the fluctuations have been during the
four years since the autumn of <span class="locked">1919:—</span></p>

<p>On the experience of the past three years, francs
and lire are at their best in April and May and at their
worst between October and December. Sterling is
not quite so punctual in its movements, the best
point of the year falling somewhere between March and
June and the worst between August and November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>The comparative stability of the highest and
lowest quotations respectively in each year, especially
in the case of Italy, is very striking, and indicates that
a policy of stabilisation at some mean figure might
have been practicable; whilst, on the other hand, the
wide divergences between the highest and lowest are
a measure of the expense and interference that trade
has suffered.</p>

<p>These results correspond so closely to the facts of
seasonal trade (see above, <a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>) that we may safely
attribute most of the major fluctuations of the
exchanges from month to month to the actual pressure
of trade remittances, and not to speculation. Speculators,
indeed, by anticipating the movements tend
to make them occur a little earlier than they would
occur otherwise, but by thus spreading the pressure
more evenly through the year their influence is to
diminish the absolute amount of the fluctuation.
General opinion greatly overestimates the influence
of exchange-speculators acting under the stimulus
of merely political and sentimental considerations.
Except for brief periods the influence of the speculator
is washed out; and political events can only
exert a lasting influence on the exchanges, in so far
as they modify the internal price level, the volume
of trade, or the ability of a country to borrow on
foreign markets. A political event, which does
not materially affect any of these facts, cannot
exert a lasting effect on the exchanges merely by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
its influence on sentiment. The only important
exception to this statement is where there exists
on a large scale a long-period speculative investment
in a country’s currency on the part of foreigners,
as in the case of German marks. But such investments
are comparable to borrowing abroad and
exercise a different kind of influence altogether
from a speculative transaction proper, which is
opened with the intention of its being closed again
within a short period. And even speculative investment
in a currency, since it is bound to diminish
sooner or later, cannot permanently prevent the
exchanges from reaching the equilibrium justified by
conditions of trading and relative price levels.</p>

<p>It follows that, whilst purely seasonal fluctuations
do not interfere with the forces which determine the
ultimate equilibrium of the exchanges, nevertheless
stability of the exchange from day to day cannot be
maintained merely by the <em>fact</em> of stability in these
underlying conditions. It is necessary also that
bankers should have a sufficiently certain <em>expectation</em>
of such stability to induce them to look after the daily
and seasonal fluctuations of the market in return for
a moderate commission.</p>

<p>After recent experience it is unlikely that they
will actually entertain any such expectation, even
if the underlying facts were of a kind to justify it,
with sufficient conviction to act, unless it is backed
up by a guarantee on the part of the Central Authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
(Bank or Government) to employ all their resources for
the maintenance of the level of exchange at a stated
figure. At present the declared official policy is to
bring the franc and the lira (for example) back to par,
so that operations favouring a fall of these currencies
are not free from danger. On the other hand no steps
are taken to make this policy effective, and the conditions
of internal finance in France and Italy indicate
that their exchanges may go much worse. Thus,
since no one can have complete confidence whether
they are to be a great deal better or very much
worse, there must be a wide fluctuation before
financiers will come in, purely from motives of self-interest,
to balance the day-to-day fluctuations and
the month-to-month fluctuations round about the
unpredictable point of equilibrium.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the exchanges are not stabilised
by policy, they will never come to an equilibrium
of themselves. As time goes on and experience
accumulates, the oscillations may be smaller than
at present. Speculators may come in a little sooner,
and importers may make greater efforts to spread
their requirements more evenly over the year. But
even so, there must be a substantial difference of
rates between the busy season and the slack season,
until the business world knows for certain at what
level the exchanges in question are going to settle
down. Thus a seasonal fluctuation of the exchanges
(including the sterling-dollar exchange) is inevitable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
even in the absence of any decided long-period
tendency of an exchange to rise or to fall, unless the
Central Authority, by a guarantee of convertibility or
otherwise, takes special steps to provide against it.</p>

<h3 id="sec_11">IV. <i>The Forward Market in Exchanges.</i></h3>

<p>When a merchant buys or sells goods in a foreign
currency the transaction is not always for immediate
settlement by cash or negotiable bill. During the
interval before he can cover himself by buying or
selling (as the case may be) the foreign currency
involved, he runs an exchange risk, losses or gains
on which may often, in these days, swamp his trading
profit. He is thus involuntarily engaged in a heavy
risk of a kind which it is hardly in his province to
undertake. The subject of what follows is a piece
of financial machinery—namely, the market in “forward”
exchanges as distinguished from “spot”
exchanges—for enabling the merchant to avoid this
risk, not, indeed, during the interval when he is
negotiating the contract, but as soon as the negotiation
is completed.</p>

<p>Transactions in “spot” exchange are for cash—that
is to say, cash in one currency is exchanged
for cash in another currency. But merchants who
have bought goods in terms of foreign currency for
future delivery may not have the cash available
pending delivery of the goods; whilst merchants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
who have sold goods in terms of foreign currency,
but are not yet in a position to sell a draft on the
buyer, cannot, even if they have plenty of cash in
their own currency, protect themselves by a “spot”
sale of the exchange involved, save in the exceptional
case when they have cash available in the foreign
currency also.</p>

<p>A “forward” contract is for the conclusion of a
“spot” transaction in exchanges at a later date,
fixed on the basis of the spot rate prevailing at the
original date. Pending the date of the maturity of
the forward contract no cash need pass (although,
of course, the contracting party may be required
to give some security or other evidence for his ability
to complete the contract in due course), so that the
merchant entering into a forward contract is not
required to find cash any sooner than if he ran the
risk on the exchange until the goods were delivered;
yet he is protected from the consequences of any
fluctuation in the exchanges in the meantime.</p>

<p>The tables given below show that in London, in
the case of the exchanges which have a big market
(the dollar, the franc, and the lira), competition
between dealers has brought down the charges for
these facilities to a fairly moderate rate. During
1920 and 1921 the cost to an English buyer of foreign
currency for forward delivery was a little more
expensive than for spot delivery in the case of francs,
lire, and marks, and a little cheaper in the case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
dollars. Correspondingly, French, Italian, and German
merchants were generally in a position to buy both
sterling and dollars for forward delivery at a slightly
cheaper rate than for spot delivery—that is to say,
if they dealt in London. As regards the rates charged
in foreign centres my information is not extensive,
but it indicates that in Milan, for example, very
much less favourable terms for these transactions
are frequently charged to the seller of forward
sterling than those ruling in London. During 1922,
however, the effect of the progressive cheapening of
money in London was, for reasons to be explained
in a moment, to cheapen the cost to English
buyers of foreign currency for forward delivery,
forward francs falling to an appreciable discount
on spot francs, and forward dollars becoming at
the end of the year decidedly cheaper than spot
dollars. Later on, the raising of the bank-rate in
June 1923 acted again, as could have been predicted,
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Proceeding to details, we see below (pp. 118, 119)
the quotations for forward exchange ruling in the
London market since the beginning of 1920. During
1920–21 forward dollars were generally cheaper than
spot dollars to a London buyer to the extent of
from 1 to 1½ per cent per annum. Occasionally,
however, when big movements of the exchange were
taking place, the discount on forward dollars was
temporarily much higher, having risen, for example,
in November 1920, when sterling was at its lowest
point, to nearly 6 per cent—for reasons which I will
endeavour to elucidate later. During the first half
of 1922 the discount on forward dollars dwindled,
but rose again during the latter half of the year,
reacting again in the middle of 1923 after money
rates in London had been slightly raised. Thus a
London merchant, who has had dollar commitments
for the purchase of goods, has not only been able to
cover his exchange risk by means of a forward transaction,
but on the average he has got his exchange
a little cheaper by providing for it in advance.</p>

<p>Forward purchases of francs, after being dearer
than spot transactions by 2½ per cent per annum
or more from the middle of 1920 to the middle of
1921, were nearly level in price from the middle of
1921 to the middle of 1922, whilst since that time
they have been ½ to 2½ per cent per annum cheaper.
In the case of lire there have been much wider gaps,
forward purchases being frequently 3 per cent or
more dearer than spot. In the case of German marks,
the forward rate, after ranging round about 5 per
cent per annum dearer than spot, has reached, since
the autumn of 1922 and the complete collapse of the
mark, a figure fantastically cheaper, thus reflecting
the sensational rate of interest for short loans current
inside Germany.</p>

<p>But in all these cases (except in Germany since
the complete collapse of the mark), whether forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
exchange is at a discount or at a premium
on spot, the expense, if any, of dealing forward
has been small in relation to the risks that are
avoided.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in practice merchants do not avail
themselves of these facilities to the extent that might
have been expected. The nature of forward dealings
in exchange is not generally understood. The rates
are seldom quoted in the newspapers. There are few
financial topics of equal importance which have
received so little discussion or publicity. The present
situation did not exist before the war (although
even at that time forward rates for the dollar were
regularly quoted), and did not begin until after the
“unpegging” of the leading exchanges in 1919, so
that the business world has only begun to adapt itself.
Moreover, for the ordinary man, dealing in forward
exchange has, it seems, a smack of speculation about
it. Unlike Manchester cotton spinners, who have
learnt by long experience that it is not the hedging
of open cotton commitments on the Liverpool futures
market, but the failure to do so, which is speculative,
merchants, who buy or sell goods of which the price
is expressed in a foreign currency, do not yet regard
it as part of the normal routine of prudent business
to hedge these indirect exchange commitments by
a transaction in forward exchange.</p>

<p>It is important, on the other hand, not to exaggerate
the extent to which, at the present time, merchants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
can by this means protect themselves from risk.
In the first place, for reasons, some of which will be
considered below, it is only in certain of the leading
exchanges that these transactions can be carried out
at a reasonable charge. It is not clear that even
the banks themselves have yet learnt to look on the
provision for their clients of such facilities at fair
and reasonable rates as one of the most useful services
they can offer. They have been too much influenced,
perhaps, by the fear that these facilities might tend
at the same time to increase speculation.</p>

<p>But there is a further qualification, not to be overlooked,
to the value of forward transactions as a
protection against risk. The price of a particular
commodity, in terms of a particular currency, does
not exactly respond to changes in the value of that
currency on the exchange markets of the world,
with the result that a movement in a country’s
exchanges may, in the case of a commodity of which
that country is a large seller or a large purchaser,
change the commodity’s world-value expressed in
terms of gold. In that case a merchant, even though
he is hedged in respect of the exchange itself, may
lose, in respect of his unsold trading stocks, through
a movement in the world-value of the commodity
he is dealing in, directly occasioned by the exchange
fluctuation.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>If we turn to the theoretical analysis of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
forward market, what is it that determines the
amount and the sign (whether plus or minus) of
the divergence between the spot and forward rates
as recorded above?</p>

<p>If dollars one month forward are quoted cheaper
than spot dollars to a London buyer in terms of
sterling, this indicates a preference by the market,
on balance, in favour of holding funds in New York
during the month in question rather than in London,—a
preference the degree of which is measured by
the discount on forward dollars. For if spot dollars
are worth $4.40 to the pound and dollars one month
forward $4.40½ to the pound, then the owner of
$4.40 can, by selling the dollars spot and buying
them back one month forward, find himself at
the end of the month with $4.40½, merely by
being during the month the owner of £1 in London
instead of $4.40 in New York. That he should
require and can obtain half a cent, which, earned
in one month, is equal to about 1½ per cent per
annum, to induce him to do the transaction, shows,
and is, under conditions of competition, a measure of,
the market’s preference for holding funds during the
month in question in New York rather than in London.</p>

<p>Conversely, if francs, lire, and marks one month
forward are quoted dearer than the spot rates to a
London buyer, this indicates a preference for holding
funds in London rather than in Paris, Rome, or
Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>The difference between the spot and forward rates
is, therefore, precisely and exactly the measure of
the preference of the money and exchange market
for holding funds in one international centre rather
than in another, <em>the exchange risk apart</em>, that is to
say under conditions in which the exchange risk
is covered. What is it that determines these
preferences?</p>

<p>1. The most fundamental cause is to be found in
the interest rates obtainable on “short” money—that
is to say, on money lent or deposited for short
periods of time in the money markets of the two
centres under comparison. If by lending dollars in
New York for one month the lender could earn
interest at the rate of 5½ per cent per annum, whereas
by lending sterling in London for one month he could
only earn interest at the rate of 4 per cent, then the
preference observed above for holding funds in New
York rather than in London is wholly explained.
That is to say, forward quotations for the purchase
of the currency of the dearer money market tend
to be cheaper than spot quotations by a percentage
per month equal to the excess of the interest which
can be earned in a month in the dearer market
over what can be earned in the cheaper. It must
be noticed that the governing factor is the rate of
interest obtainable for short periods, so that a country
where, owing to the absence or ill-development of
an organised money market, it is difficult to lend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
money satisfactorily at call or for very short periods,
may, for the purposes of this calculation, reckon as
a low interest-earning market, even though the
prevailing rate of interest for longer periods is not
low at all. This consideration generally tends to
make London and New York more attractive markets
for short money than any Continental centres.</p>

<p>The effect of the cheap money rates ruling in
London from the middle of 1922 to the middle of
1923 in diminishing the attractiveness of London as
a depository of funds is strikingly shown, in the above
tables, by the cheapening of the forward quotations
of foreign currencies relatively to the spot quotations.
In the case of the dollar the forward quotation had
risen by the beginning of 1923 to a rate 3 per cent per
annum above the spot quotation (<i>i.e.</i> forward dollars
were 3 per cent per annum <em>cheaper</em> than spot dollars
in terms of sterling), which meant (subject to modification
by the other influences to be mentioned below)
that the effective rate for short loans approached
3 per cent higher in New York than in London.</p>

<p>In the case of francs forward quotations which
had been below spot, so long as money was dear in
London, rose above the spot quotations, thus indicating
that the relative dearness of money in London
as compared with Paris had disappeared; whilst in
the case of lire forward quotations, although still
below spot quotations, rose, under the same influence,
nearer to the spot level. Nevertheless, in the case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
both these currencies, a preponderance of bearish
anticipations about their future prospects probably
also played a part, for the reasons given in detail
below, in producing the observed result.</p>

<p>The most interesting figures, however, are those
relating to marks, which illustrate vividly what I
have mentioned on page 23 above concerning the
enormous money rates of interest current in Germany
subsequent to the collapse of October 1922, as a
result of the effort of the real rate of interest to
remain positive in face of a general anticipation of a
catastrophic collapse of the monetary unit. It will
be noticed that the effective short money rate of
interest in terms of marks ranged from 50 per cent
per annum upwards, until finally the quotations were
merely nominal.</p>

<p>2. If questions of credit did not enter in, the
factor of the rate of interest on short loans would
be the dominating one. Indeed, as between London
and New York, it probably is so under existing
conditions. Between London and Paris it is still
important. But elsewhere the various uncertainties
of financial and political risk, which the war has
left behind, introduce a further element which
sometimes quite transcends the factor of relative
interest. The possibility of financial trouble or
political disturbance, and the quite appreciable probability
of a moratorium in the event of any difficulties
arising, or of the sudden introduction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
exchange regulations which would interfere with the
movement of balances out of the country, and even
sometimes the contingency of a drastic demonetisation,—all
these factors deter bankers, even when the
exchange risk proper is eliminated, from maintaining
large floating balances at certain foreign centres.
Such risks prevent the business from being based,
as it should be, on a mathematical calculation of
interest rates; they obliterate by their possible
magnitude the small “turns” which can be earned
out of differences between interest rates plus a normal
banker’s commission; and, being incalculable, they
may even deter conservative bankers from doing
the business on a substantial scale at any reasonable
rate at all. In the case of Roumania or Poland,
for example, this factor is, at times, the dominating
one.</p>

<p>3. There is a third factor of some significance.
We have assumed so far that the forward rate is
fixed at such a level that the dealer or banker can
cover himself by a simultaneous spot transaction
and be left with a reasonable profit for his trouble.
But it is not necessary to cover every forward transaction
by a corresponding spot transaction; it may
be possible to “marry” a forward sale with a forward
purchase of the same currency. For example, whilst
some of the market’s clients may wish to sell forward
dollars, other clients will wish to buy forward dollars.
In this case the market can set off these, one against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the other, in its books, and there will be no need of
any movement of cash funds in either direction.
The third factor depends, therefore, on whether it
is the sellers or the buyers of forward dollars who
predominate. To fix our minds, let us suppose that
money-market conditions exist in which a sale of
forward dollars against the purchase of spot dollars,
at a discount of 1½ per cent per annum for the former,
yields neither profit nor loss. Now if in these conditions
the purchasers of forward dollars, other than
arbitragers, exceed sellers of forward dollars, then this
excess of demand for forward dollars can be met by
arbitragers, who have cash resources in London, at
a discount which falls short of 1½ per cent per annum
by such amount (say ½ per cent) as will yield the
arbitragers sufficient profit for their trouble. If,
however, sellers of forward dollars exceed the purchasers,
then a sufficient discount has to be accepted
by the former to induce arbitrage the other way
round—that is to say, by arbitragers who have cash
resources in New York—namely, a discount which
exceeds 1½ per cent per annum by, say, ½ per cent.
Thus the discount on forward dollars will fluctuate
between 1 and 2 per cent per annum according as
buyers or sellers predominate.</p>

<p>4. Lastly, we have to provide for the case, quite
frequent in practice, where our assumption of a large
and free market breaks down. A business in forward
exchange can only be transacted by banks or similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
institutions. If the bulk of the business in a particular
exchange is in a few hands, or if there is a tacit
agreement between the principal institutions concerned
to maintain differences which will allow more
than a competitive profit, then the surcharge representing
the profit of a bank for arbitraging between
spot and forward transactions may much exceed
the moderate figure indicated above. The quotations
of the rates charged in Milan for forward
dealings in lire, when compared with the rates
current in London at the same date, indicate that
a bank which is free to operate in both markets
can frequently make an abnormal profit.</p>

<p>But there is a further contingency of considerable
importance which occurs when speculation is exceptionally
active and is all one way. It must be
remembered that the floating capital normally available,
and ready to move from centre to centre for
the purpose of taking advantage of moderate arbitrage
profits between spot and forward exchange, is by
no means unlimited in amount, and is not always
adequate to the market’s requirements. When, for
example, the market is feeling unusually bullish of
the European exchanges as against sterling, or of
sterling as against dollars, the pressure to sell forward
sterling or dollars, as the case may be, may drive
the forward price of these currencies to a discount
on their spot price which represents an altogether
abnormal profit to any one who is in a position to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
buy these currencies forward and sell them spot.
This abnormal discount can only disappear when the
high profit of arbitrage between spot and forward
has drawn fresh capital into the arbitrage business.
So few persons understand even the elements of
the theory of the forward exchanges that there
was an occasion in 1920, even between London and
New York, when a seller of spot dollars could earn
at the rate of 6 per cent per annum above the London
rate for short money by converting his dollars into
sterling and providing at the same time by a forward
sale of the sterling for reconversion into dollars in a
month’s time; whilst, according to figures supplied
me, it was possible, at the end of February 1921,
by selling spot sterling in Milan and buying it back
a month forward, to earn at the rate of more than
25 per cent per annum over and above any interest
obtainable on a month’s deposit of cash lire in Milan.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice that when the differences
between forward and spot rates have become temporarily
abnormal, thus indicating an exceptional
pressure of speculative activity, the speculators
have often turned out to be right. For example,
the abnormal discount on forward dollars, which
persisted more or less from November 1920 to
February 1921, thus indicating that the market was
a bull of sterling, coincided with the sensational
rise of sterling from 3.45 to 3.90. This discount was
at its maximum when sterling touched its lowest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
point and at its minimum (in the middle of May 1921)
when sterling reached its highest point on that swing,
which showed a remarkably accurate anticipation of
events by the balance of professional opinion. The
comparatively high discount on forward dollars
current at the end of 1922 may, in the same way,
have been partly due to an excess of bull speculation
in favour of sterling based on an expectation of its
recovery towards par, and not merely to the cheapness
of money in London as compared with New York.</p>

<p>The same thing seems to have been true for the
franc. In January and February 1921, the abnormal
premium on the forward franc indicated that, in
the view of the market, the franc had fallen too
low, which turned out to be the case. They turned
round at the precise moment when the franc reached
its highest value (end of July 1921), and were right
again. During the first five months of 1922, when
the franc was almost stable, spot and forward quotations
were practically at par with one another,
whilst the progressive fall of the franc since June
1922 has been accompanied by a steady and sometimes
substantial discount on forward francs; indicating,
on this test, that the professional market was
bearish of francs and therefore right once more. The
lira tells somewhat the same tale. Thus, whilst the
reader can see for himself by a study of the tables that
no precise generalisation would be accurate, nevertheless
the market has been broadly right when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
has taken a very decided view, as measured by forward
rates.</p>

<p>This result may seem surprising in view of the
huge amounts which exchange speculators in European
currencies, more particularly on the bull side, are
reputed to have lost. But the mass of amateur
speculators throughout the world operate by cash
purchases of the currency of which they are bulls,
forward transactions being neither known nor available
to them. Such speculation may afford temporary
support to the spot exchange, but it has no influence
on the difference between spot and forward, the
subject now under discussion. The above conclusion
is limited to the fact that when the type of professional
speculation which makes use of the forward
market is exceptionally active and united in its
opinion, it has proved roughly correct, and has,
therefore, been a useful factor in moderating the
extreme fluctuations which would have occurred
otherwise.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Out of the various practical conclusions which
might be drawn from this discussion and the figures
which accompany it, I will pick out three.</p>

<p>1. Those exchanges in which the fluctuations are
wildest and the merchant is most in need of facilities
for hedging his risk are precisely those in which
facilities for forward dealing at moderate rates are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
least developed. But this is to be explained, not
necessarily by the instability of the exchange in
itself, but by certain accompanying circumstances,
such as distrust of the country’s internal arrangements
or its banking credit, a fear of the sudden
imposition of exchange regulations or of a moratorium,
and the other analogous influences mentioned above
(pp. 126–7). There is no theoretical reason why there
should not be an excellent forward market in a highly
unstable exchange. In those countries, therefore,
where regulation is still premature, it may nevertheless
be possible to mitigate the evil consequences
of fluctuation by organising facilities for forward
dealings.</p>

<p>This is a function which the State banks of such
countries could usefully perform. For this they
must either themselves command a certain amount
of foreign currency or they must provide facilities
for accepting short-period deposits in their own
currency from foreign bankers, on conditions which
inspire these bankers with complete confidence in
the freedom and liquidity of such deposits. Various
technical devices could be suggested. But the
simplest method might be for the State banks themselves
to enter the forward market and offer to buy
or sell forward exchange at a reasonable discount or
premium on the spot quotation. I suggest that they
should deal not direct with the public but only with
approved banks and financial houses, from whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
they should require adequate security; that they
should quote every day their rates for buying and
selling exchange either one or three months forward;
but that such quotation should take the form, not of
a price for the exchange itself, but of a percentage
difference between spot and forward, and should be a
quotation for the double transaction of a spot deal one
way and a simultaneous forward deal the other—<i>e.g.</i>
the Bank of Italy might offer to sell spot sterling and
buy forward sterling at a premium of ⅛ per cent per
month for the former over the latter, and to buy
spot sterling and sell forward sterling at par. For
the transaction of such business the State banks
would require to command a certain amount of
resources abroad, either in cash or in borrowing
facilities. But this fund would be a revolving one,
automatically replenished at the maturity of the
forward contracts, so that it need not be on anything
like the scale necessary for a fund for the purpose
of supporting the exchange. Nor is it a business
which involves any more risk than is inherent in
all banking business as such; from exchange risk
proper is free.</p>

<p>With free forward markets thus established no
merchant need run an exchange risk unless he wishes
to, and business might find a stable foothold even
in a fluctuating world. A recommendation in favour
of action along these lines was included amongst the
Financial Resolutions of the Genoa Conference of 1922.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>I shall develop below (Chap. V.) a proposal that
the Bank of England should strengthen its control by
fixing spot and forward prices for gold every Thursday
just as it now fixes its discount rate. But other
Central Banks also would increase their control over
fluctuations in exchange if they were to adopt the
above plan of quoting rates for forward exchange in
terms of spot exchange. By varying these rates
they would be able, in effect, to vary the interest
offered for <em>foreign</em> balances, as a policy distinct from
whatever might be their bank-rate policy for the
purpose of governing the interest obtainable on <em>home</em>
balances.</p>

<p>2. It is not unusual at present for banks to
endeavour to distinguish between speculative dealings
in forward exchange and dealings which are intended
to hedge a commercial transaction, with a view to
discouraging the former; whilst official exchange
regulations in many countries have been aimed at
such discrimination. I think that this is a mistake.
Banks should take stringent precautions to make
sure that their clients are in a position to meet any
losses which may accrue without serious embarrassment.
But, having fully assured themselves on this
point, it is not useful that they should inquire further—for
the following reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is almost impossible to prevent
the evasion of such regulations; whilst, if the business
is driven to methods of evasion, it tends to be pressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
underground, to yield excessive profits to middlemen,
and to fall into undesirable hands.</p>

<p>But, what is more important and is less appreciated,
the speculator with resources can provide a useful,
indeed almost an essential, service. Since the volume
of actual trade is spread unevenly through the year,
the seasonal fluctuation, as explained above, is bound
to occur with undue force unless some financial,
non-commercial factor steps in to balance matters.
A free forward market, from which speculative
transactions are not excluded, will give by far the best
facilities for the trader, who does not wish to speculate,
to avoid doing so. The same sort of advantages
will be secured for merchants generally as are afforded,
for example, to the cotton trade by the dealings in
“futures” in the New York and Liverpool markets.
Where risk is unavoidably present, it is much better
that it should be carried by those who are qualified
or are desirous to bear it, than by traders, who have
neither the qualification nor the desire to do so,
and whose minds it distracts from their own business.
The wide fluctuations in the leading exchanges over
the past three years, as distinct from their persisting
depreciation, have been due, not to the presence of
speculation, but to the absence of a sufficient volume
of it relatively to the volume of trade.</p>

<p>3. A failure to analyse the relation between spot
and forward exchange may be, sometimes, partly
responsible for a mistaken bank-rate policy. Dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
money—that is to say, high interest rates for short-period
loans—has two effects. The one is indirect
and gradual—namely, in diminishing the volume of
credit quoted by the banks. This effect is much
the same now as it always was. It is desirable
to produce it when prices are rising and business
is trying to expand faster than the supply of real
capital and effective demand can permit in the long
run. It is undesirable when prices are falling and
trade is depressed.</p>

<p>The other effect of dear money, or rather of dearer
money in one centre than in another, used to be to
draw gold from the cheaper centre for temporary
employment in the dearer. But nowadays the only
immediate effect is to cause a new adjustment of
the difference between the spot and forward rates
of exchange between the two centres. If money
becomes dearer in London, the discount on forward
dollars diminishes or gives way to a premium. The
effect has been pointed out above of the relative
cheapening of money in London in the latter half of
1922 in increasing the discount on forward dollars,
and of the relative raising of money-rates in the
middle of 1923 in diminishing the discount. Such
are, in present circumstances, the principal direct
consequences of a moderate difference between interest
rates in the two centres, apart, of course, from the
indirect, long-period influence. Since no one is likely
to remit money temporarily from one money market<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to another on any important scale, with an uncovered
exchange risk, merely to take advantage of ½ or 1 per
cent per annum difference in the interest rate, the
direct effect of dearer money on the <em>absolute</em> level
of the exchanges, as distinguished from the difference
between spot and forward, is very small, being limited
to the comparatively slight influence which the relation
between spot and forward rates exerts on exchange
speculators.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">39</a> The pressure of arbitragers between
spot and forward exchange, seeking to take advantage
of the new situation, leads to a rapid adjustment of
the difference between these rates, until the business
of temporary remittance, as distinct from exchange
speculation, is no more profitable than it was before,
and consequently does not occur on any increased
scale; with the result that there is no marked effect
on the absolute level of the spot rate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="fnanchor">39</a> If interest rates are raised in London, the discount on forward dollars
will decrease or a premium will appear. This is likely to have some influence
in encouraging speculative sales of forward dollars (how much influence
depends on the proportion borne by the difference between the spot and
forward rates to the probable range of fluctuation of the spot rate which
the speculator anticipates); and in so far as this is the case, the covering
sales of spot dollars by banks will move the rate of exchange in favour of
London.</p>

</div>

<p>The reasons given for the maintenance of a close
relationship between the Bank of England’s rate and
that of the American Federal Reserve Board sometimes
show confusion. The eventual influence of an
effective high bank-rate on the general situation
is undisputed; but the belief that a moderate difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
between bank-rates in London and New York
reacts directly on the sterling-dollar exchange, as it
used to do under a régime of convertibility, is a
misapprehension. The direct reaction of this difference
is on the discount for forward dollars as against
spot dollars; and it cannot much affect the absolute
level of the spot rate unless the change in relative
money-rates is comparable in magnitude (as it used to
be but no longer is) with the possible range of exchange
fluctuations.</p>

<span class="subhead">ALTERNATIVE AIMS IN MONETARY POLICY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Our</span> first two chapters, on the evils proceeding from
instability in the purchasing power of money and on
the part played by the exigencies of Public Finance,
have indicated the practical importance of our subject
to the welfare of society. In the third chapter an
attempt has been made to lay a foundation of theory
upon which to raise constructions. We can now turn,
in this and the following chapter, to <em>Remedies</em>.</p>

<p>The instability of money has been compounded,
in most countries except the United States, of two
elements: the failure of the national currencies to
remain stable in terms of what was supposed to be
the standard of value, namely gold; and the failure
of gold itself to remain stable in terms of purchasing
power. Attention has been mainly concentrated (<i>e.g.</i>
by the Cunliffe Committee) on the first of these two
factors. It is often assumed that the restoration
of the gold standard, that is to say, of the convertibility
of each national currency at a fixed rate
in terms of gold, must be, in any case, our objective;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and that the main question of controversy is whether
national currencies should be restored to their pre-war
gold value or to some lower value nearer to the
present facts; in other words, the choice between
<em>Deflation</em> and <em>Devaluation</em>.</p>

<p>This assumption is hasty. If we glance at the
course of prices during the last five years, it is obvious
that the United States, which has enjoyed a gold
standard throughout, has suffered as severely as many
other countries, that in the United Kingdom the
instability of gold has been a larger factor than the
instability of the exchange, that the same is true
even of France, and that in Italy it has been nearly
as large. On the other hand, in India, which has
suffered violent exchange fluctuations, the standard
of value, as we shall see below, has been more stable
than in any other country.</p>

<p>We should not, therefore, by fixing the exchanges
get rid of our currency troubles. It is even possible
that this step might weaken our control. The
problem of stabilisation has several sides, which we
must consider one by one:</p>

<p>1. Devaluation <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">versus</i> Deflation. Do we wish to
fix the standard of value, whether or not it be
gold, near the existing value? Or do we wish to
restore it to the pre-war value?</p>

<p>2. Stability of Prices <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">versus</i> Stability of Exchange.
Is it more important that the value of a national
currency should be stable in terms of purchasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
power, or stable in terms of the currency of certain
foreign countries?</p>

<p>3. The Restoration of a Gold Standard. In the
light of our answers to the first two questions, is a
gold standard, however imperfect in theory, the best
available method for attaining our ends in practice?</p>

<p>Having decided between these alternative aims,
we can proceed, in the next chapter, to some constructive
suggestions.</p>

<h3 id="sec_12">I. <i>Devaluation</i> versus <i>Deflation</i>.</h3>

<p>The policy of reducing the ratio between the
volume of a country’s currency and its requirements
of purchasing power in the form of money, so as to
increase the exchange value of the currency in terms
of gold or of commodities, is conveniently called
<em>Deflation</em>.</p>

<p>The alternative policy of stabilising the value of
the currency somewhere near its present value, without
regard to its pre-war value, is called <em>Devaluation</em>.</p>

<p>Up to the date of the Genoa Conference of April
1922, these two policies were not clearly distinguished
by the public, and the sharp opposition between
them has been only gradually appreciated. Even
now (October 1923) there is scarcely any European
country in which the authorities have made it clear
whether their policy is to stabilise the value of their
currency or to raise it. Stabilisation at the existing
level has been recommended by International<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
Conferences;<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">40</a> and the actual value of many currencies
tends to fall rather than to rise. But, to judge from
other indications, the heart’s desire of the State
Banks of Europe, whether they pursue it successfully,
as in Czecho-Slovakia, or unsuccessfully, as in France,
is to <em>raise</em> the value of their currencies. In only
one country so far have practical steps been taken
to <em>fix</em> the exchange, namely in Austria.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="fnanchor">40</a> Whilst the Conference of Genoa (April 1922) affirmed the doctrine in
general, representatives of the countries chiefly affected were united in
declaring that it must not be applied to them in particular. Signor Peano,
M. Picard, and M. Theunis, speaking on behalf of Italy, France, and Belgium,
announced, each for his own country, that they would have nothing to do
with devaluating, and were determined to restore their respective currencies
to their pre-war values. Reform is not likely to come by joint, simultaneous
action. The experts of Genoa recognised this when they “ventured to
suggest” that “a considerable service will be rendered by that country
which first decides boldly to set the example of securing immediate stability
in terms of gold” by devaluation.</p>

</div>

<p>The simple arguments against Deflation fall under
two heads.</p>

<p>In the first place, Deflation is not <em>desirable</em>, because
it effects, what is always harmful, a change in the
existing Standard of Value, and redistributes wealth
in a manner injurious, at the same time, to business
and to social stability. Deflation, as we have already
seen, involves a transference of wealth from the rest
of the community to the <em>rentier</em> class and to all
holders of titles to money; just as inflation involves
the opposite. In particular it involves a transference
from all borrowers, that is to say from traders, manufacturers,
and farmers, to lenders, from the active to
the inactive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>But whilst the oppression of the taxpayer for the
enrichment of the <em>rentier</em> is the chief lasting result,
there is another, more violent, disturbance during the
period of transition. The policy of gradually raising
the value of a country’s money to (say) 100 per cent
above its present value in terms of goods—I repeat
here the arguments of Chapter I.—amounts to giving
notice to every merchant and every manufacturer,
that for some time to come his stock and his raw
materials will steadily depreciate on his hands, and
to every one who finances his business with borrowed
money that he will, sooner or later, lose 100 per
cent on his liabilities (since he will have to pay back
in terms of commodities twice as much as he has
borrowed). Modern business, being carried on largely
with borrowed money, must necessarily be brought
to a standstill by such a process. It will be to the
interest of every one in business to go out of business
for the time being; and of every one who is contemplating
expenditure to postpone his orders so long
as he can. The wise man will be he who turns his
assets into cash, withdraws from the risks and the
exertions of activity, and awaits in country retirement
the steady appreciation promised him in the value of
his cash. A probable expectation of Deflation is bad
enough; a certain expectation is disastrous. For
the mechanism of the modern business world is even
less adapted to fluctuations in the value of money
upwards than it is to fluctuations downwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p>In the second place, in many countries, Deflation,
even were it desirable, is not <em>possible</em>; that is to say,
Deflation in sufficient degree to restore the currency
to its pre-war parity. For the burden which it would
throw on the taxpayer would be insupportable. I need
add nothing on this to what I have already written in
the second chapter above. This practical impossibility
might have rendered the policy innocuous, if it were
not that, by standing in the way of the alternative
policy, it prolongs the period of uncertainty and severe
seasonal fluctuation, and even, in some cases, can be
carried into effect sufficiently to cause much interference
with business. The fact, that the restoration of
their currencies to the pre-war parity is still the declared
official policy of the French and Italian Governments,
is preventing, in those countries, any rational
discussion of currency reform. All those—and
in the financial world they are many—who have
reasons for wishing to appear “correct,” are compelled
to talk foolishly. In Italy, where sound economic
views have much influence and which may be nearly
ripe for currency reform, Signor Mussolini has
threatened to raise the lira to its former value.
Fortunately for the Italian taxpayer and Italian
business, the lira does not listen even to a dictator
and cannot be given castor oil. But such talk can
postpone positive reform; though it may be doubted
if so good a politician would have propounded such
a policy, even in bravado and exuberance, if he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
understood that, expressed in other but equivalent
words, it was as follows: “My policy is to halve
wages, double the burden of the National Debt,
and to reduce by 50 per cent the prices which Sicily
can get for her exports of oranges and lemons.”</p>

<p>One single country—Czechoslovakia—has made
the experiment on a modest but sufficient scale.
Comparatively free from the burden of internal
debt, and free also from serious budgetary deficits,
Czechoslovakia was able in the course of 1922, in
pursuance of the policy of her Finance Minister,
Dr. Alois Rasin, to employ the proceeds of certain
foreign loans to improve the exchange value of the
Czech crown to nearly three times the rate which
had been touched in the previous year. The policy
has cost her an industrial crisis and serious unemployment.
To what purpose? I do not know.
Even now the Czech crown is not worth a sixth of
its pre-war parity; and it remains unstabilised,
fluttering before the breath of the seasons and the
wind of politics. Is, therefore, the process of appreciation
to continue indefinitely? If not, when and at
what point is stabilisation to be effected? Czechoslovakia
was better placed than any country in
Europe to establish her economic life on the basis
of a sound and fixed currency. Her finances were
in equilibrium, her credit good, her foreign resources
adequate, and no one could have blamed her for
devaluating the crown, ruined by no fault of hers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
and inherited from the Habsburg Empire. Pursuing
a misguided policy in a spirit of stern virtue, she
preferred the stagnation of her industries and a still
fluctuating standard.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="fnanchor">41</a> I cannot criticise the work, in his second term of office (1922), of
Dr. Rasin, now fallen by the hand of an assassin, without reference to his
great achievement during his first term (1919) in rescuing his country’s
currency from the surrounding chaos. The stamping of the Austrian
notes and the levy on holders of titles to money which accompanied it
was the only drastic, courageous, and successful measure of finance carried
through anywhere in Europe at that epoch; the story of it from Dr.
Rasin’s own pen can be read in his <cite>The Financial Policy of Czecho-Slovakia</cite>.
Before he had finished other influences became dominant. But, when in
1922 this austere and disinterested Minister returned to office, he missed,
in my judgment, his opportunity. He could have completed his task by
establishing the currency on a fixed and stable basis, instead of which
he used his great authority to disorder trade by a futile process of Deflation.</p>

</div>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>If the restoration of many European currencies
to their pre-war parity with gold is neither desirable
nor possible, what are the forces or the arguments
which have established this undesirable impossibility
as the avowed policy of most of them? The following
are the most important:</p>

<p>1. <em>To leave the gold value of a country’s currency at
the low level to which war has driven it is an injustice
to the</em> rentier <em>class and to others whose income is fixed
in terms of currency, and practically a breach of
contract; whilst to restore its value would meet a
debt of honour.</em></p>

<p>The injury done to pre-war holders of fixed interest-bearing
stocks is beyond dispute. Real justice, indeed,
might require the restoration of the purchasing power,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
and not merely the gold value, of their money incomes,
a measure which no one in fact proposes; whilst
nominal justice has not been infringed, since these
investments were not in gold bullion but in the legal
tender of the realm. Nevertheless, if this class of
investors could be dealt with separately, considerations
of equity and the expedience of satisfying
reasonable expectation would furnish a strong case.</p>

<p>But this is not the actual situation. The vast
issues of War Loans have swamped the pre-war
holdings of fixed interest-bearing stocks, and society
has largely adjusted itself to the new situation. To
restore the value of pre-war holdings by Deflation
means enhancing at the same time the value of war
and post-war holdings, and thereby raising the total
claims of the <em>rentier</em> class not only beyond what they
are entitled to, but to an intolerable proportion of
the total income of the community. Indeed justice,
rightly weighed, comes down on the other side.
Much the greater proportion of the money contracts
still outstanding were entered into when money was
worth more nearly what it is worth now than what
it was worth in 1913. Thus, in order to do justice
to a minority of creditors, a great injustice would be
done to a great majority of debtors.</p>

<p>This aspect of the matter has been admirably
argued by Professor Irving Fisher.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">42</a> We forget, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
says, that not all contracts require the same adjustment
in order to secure justice, and that while we
are debating whether we ought to deflate to secure
ideal justice for those who made contracts on old
price levels, new contracts are constantly being made
at the new price levels. An estimate of the volume
of contracts now outstanding, classified according
to their age, would show that some contracts are a
day old, some are a month old, some are a year old,
some are a decade old, and some are a century old,
the great mass, however, being of very recent origin.
Consequently the average, or centre of gravity, of the
total existing indebtedness is probably always somewhat
near the present. Before the war, Professor
Fisher estimated, very roughly, that contracts in the
United States were on the average about one year old.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="fnanchor">42</a> In his article “Devaluation versus Deflation,” published in the eleventh
<cite>Manchester Guardian</cite> Reconstruction Supplement (Dec. 7, 1922).</p>

</div>

<p>When, therefore, the depreciation of the currency
has lasted long enough for society to adjust itself to
the new values, Deflation is even worse than Inflation.
Both are “unjust” and disappoint reasonable expectation.
But whereas Inflation, by easing the
burden of national debt and stimulating enterprise,
has a little to throw into the other side of the balance,
Deflation has nothing.</p>

<p>2. <em>The restoration of a currency to its pre-war gold
value enhances a country’s financial prestige and
promotes future confidence.</em></p>

<p>Where a country can hope to restore its pre-war
parity at an early date, this argument cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
neglected. This might be said of Great Britain,
Holland, Sweden, Switzerland, and (perhaps) Spain,
but of no other European country. The argument
cannot be extended to those countries which, even
if they could raise somewhat the value of their
legal-tender money, could not possibly restore it to
its old value. It is of the essence of the argument
that the <em>exact</em> pre-war parity should be recovered.
It would not make much difference to the financial
prestige of Italy whether she stabilised the lira at
100 to the £ sterling or at 60; and it would be much
better for her prestige to stabilise it definitely at 100
than to let it fluctuate between 60 and 100.</p>

<p>This argument is limited, therefore, to those
countries the gold value of whose currencies is within
(say) 5 or 10 per cent of their former value. Its force
in these cases depends, I think, upon what answer
we give to the problem discussed below, namely,
whether we intend to pin ourselves in the future,
as in the past, to an unqualified gold standard.
If we still prefer such a standard to any available
alternative, and if future “confidence” in our currency
is to depend not on the stability of its purchasing
power but on the fixity of its gold-value, then it may
be worth our while to stand the racket of Deflation
to the extent of 5 or 10 per cent. This view is
in accordance with that expressed by Ricardo in
analogous circumstances a hundred years ago.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">43</a> If,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
on the other hand, we decide to aim for the future
at stability of the price level rather than at a fixed
parity with gold, in that case <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cadit quaestio</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="fnanchor">43</a> See below, <a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>In any case this argument does not affect our
main conclusion, that the right policy for countries
of which the currency has suffered a prolonged and
severe depreciation is to <em>devaluate</em>, and to fix the
value of the currency at that figure in the neighbourhood
of the existing value to which commerce and
wages are adjusted.</p>

<p>3. <em>If the gold value of a country’s currency can be
increased, labour will profit by a reduced cost of living,
foreign goods will be obtainable cheaper, and foreign
debts fixed in terms of gold</em> (e.g. <em>to the United States)
will be discharged with less effort.</em></p>

<p>This argument, which is pure delusion, exercises
quite as much influence as the other two. If the
franc is worth more, wages, it is argued, which are
paid in francs, will surely buy more, and French
imports, which are paid for in francs, will be so much
cheaper. No! If francs are worth more they will
buy more labour as well as more goods,—that is to
say, wages will fall; and the French exports, which
pay for the imports, will, measured in francs, fall in
value just as much as the imports. Nor will it make
in the long run any difference whatever in the amount
of goods the value of which England will have to
transfer to America to pay her dollar debts, whether
in the end sterling settles down at four dollars to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
the pound, or at its pre-war parity. The burden of
this debt depends on the value of gold, in terms of
which it is fixed, not on the value of sterling. It is
not easy, it seems, for men to apprehend that their
money is a mere intermediary, without significance
in itself, which flows from one hand to another, is
received and is dispensed, and disappears when its
work is done from the sum of a nation’s wealth.</p>

<p>In concluding this section, let me quote on the
issue between Deflation and Devaluation two classic
authorities, Gibbon and Ricardo, the one to represent
the imposing but false wisdom of the would-be
upright statesman, the other to speak in clear tones
the voice of instructed reason.</p>

<p>In the eleventh chapter of <cite>The Decline and Fall</cite>,
Gibbon deems incredible a story of how in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 274
Aurelian’s deflationary zeal to restore the integrity
of the coin excited an insurrection which caused
the death of 7000 soldiers. “We might naturally
expect,” he says, “that the reformation of the coin
should have been an action equally popular with the
destruction of those obsolete accounts, which by the
emperor’s order were burnt in the forum of Trajan.
In an age when the principles of commerce were so
imperfectly understood, the most desirable end might
perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious means;
but a temporary grievance of such a nature can
scarcely excite and support a serious civil war. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
repetition of intolerable taxes, imposed either on the
land or on the necessaries of life, may at last provoke
those who will not or who cannot relinquish their
country. But the case is far otherwise in every
operation which, by whatsoever expedients, restores
the just value of money.”</p>

<p>Rome may have understood the principles of
commerce imperfectly in the third century and not
perfectly in the twentieth; but that does not save
her citizens from experiencing their applications.
Signor Mussolini might peruse with interest the annals
of Aurelian, who, “ignorant or impatient of the
restraints of civil institutions,” fell by the hand of
an assassin within a year of his deflation of the
currency, “regretted by the army, detested by the
Senate, but universally acknowledged as a warlike
and fortunate prince, the useful though severe reformer
of a degenerate State.”</p>

<p>Ricardo, speaking in the House of Commons on
the 12th of June 1822,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">44</a> gave his opinion that: “If in
the year 1819 the value of the currency had stood at
14s. for the pound note, which was the case in the
year 1813, he should have thought that, on a balance
of all the advantages and disadvantages of the case,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
it would have been as well to fix the currency at the
then value, according to which most of the existing
contracts had been made; but when the currency
was within 5 per cent of its par value, he thought
they had made the best selection in recurring to the
old standard.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="fnanchor">44</a> The great debate of June 11 and 12, 1822, on Mr. Western’s Motion
concerning the Resumption of Cash Payments, well illustrates, more
particularly in the speeches of the opener, Mr. Western, and of the opposer,
Mr. Huskisson, the regularity of the evils which follow a deflationary
raising of the standard, and the unchanging antithesis between the temperaments
of deflationists and devaluers, though I doubt if any present-day
deflationists could make a speech at the same time so able and so unfair
as Mr. Huskisson’s.</p>

</div>

<p>The same is repeated in his <cite>Protection to Agriculture</cite><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">45</a>
where he approves the restoration of the old standard
when gold was £4 : 2s. per standard ounce, but adds
that, if it had been £5 : 10s., “no measure could have
been more inexpedient than to make so violent a
change in all subsisting engagements.”</p>

<h3 id="sec_13">II. <i>Stability of Prices</i> versus <i>Stability of Exchange</i>.</h3>

<p>Since, subject to the qualification of Chapter III.,
the rate of exchange of a country’s currency with
the currency of the rest of the world (assuming
for the sake of simplicity that there is only one
external currency) depends on the relation between
the internal price level and the external price level,
it follows that the exchange cannot be stable unless
<em>both</em> internal <em>and</em> external price levels remain stable.
If, therefore, the external price level lies outside our
control, we must submit either to our own internal
price level or to our exchange being pulled about
by external influences. If the external price level
is unstable, we cannot keep <em>both</em> our own price level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
<em>and</em> our exchanges stable. And we are compelled to
choose.</p>

<p>In pre-war days, when almost the whole world
was on a gold standard, we had all plumped
for stability of exchange as against stability of
prices, and we were ready to submit to the social
consequences of a change of price level for causes
quite outside our control, connected, for example,
with the discovery of new gold mines in foreign
countries or a change of banking policy abroad.
But we submitted, partly because we did not dare
trust ourselves to a less automatic (though more
reasoned) policy, and partly because the price
fluctuations experienced were in fact moderate.
Nevertheless, there were powerful advocates of the
other choice. In particular, the proposals of Professor
Irving Fisher for a Compensated Dollar, amounted,
unless all countries adopted the same plan, to putting
into practice a preference for stability of internal
price level over stability of external exchange.</p>

<p>The right choice is not necessarily the same for
all countries. It must partly depend on the relative
importance of foreign trade in the economic life of the
country. Nevertheless, there does seem to be in
almost every case a presumption in favour of the
stability of prices, if only it can be achieved. Stability
of exchange is in the nature of a convenience which
adds to the efficiency and prosperity of those who
are engaged in foreign trade. Stability of prices,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
on the other hand, is profoundly important for the
avoidance of the various evils described in Chapter I.
Contracts and business expectations, which presume
a stable exchange, must be far fewer, even in a
trading country such as England, than those which
presume a stable level of internal prices. The main
argument to the contrary seems to be that exchange
stability is an easier aim to attain, since it only
requires that the same standard of value should be
adopted at home and abroad; whereas an internal
standard, so regulated as to maintain stability in an
index number of prices, is a difficult scientific innovation,
never yet put into practice.</p>

<p>There has been an interesting example recently of
a country which, more perhaps by chance than by
design, has secured the advantages of a relatively stable
level of internal prices at the expense of a fluctuating
exchange, namely India. Public attention is so
much fixed on the exchange as the test of the success
of a financial policy, that the Government of India,
under severe reproaches for what has happened,
have not defended themselves as effectively as they
might. During the boom of 1919–20, when world
prices were soaring, the exchange value of the rupee
was allowed to rise by successive stages, with the result
that the highest level reached by the Indian index
number in 1920 exceeded by only 12 per cent the
average figure for 1919, whereas for England the figure
was 29 per cent. The Report of the Indian Currency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Committee, on which the Government of India acted
somewhat clumsily without enough allowance for
rapidly changing conditions, was avowedly influenced
by the importance in such a country as India,
especially in the political circumstances of that time,
of avoiding a violent upward movement of internal
prices. The most just criticism of the Government
of India’s action, in the light of after-events, is that
they went too far in attempting to raise the rupee so
high as 2s. 8d.,—a rate not contemplated by the
Currency Committee. Prices outside India never
rose so high as to justify an exchange exceeding 2s. 3d.
on the criterion of keeping Indian prices stable at the
1919 level. On the other hand, when world prices
collapsed, the rupee exchange was allowed to fall with
them, again with the result that the lowest point
touched by the Indian index number in 1921 was only
16 per cent below the highest in 1920, whereas for
England the figure was 50 per cent. The following
table gives the details:</p>

<p>If the Government of India had been successful in
stabilising the rupee-sterling exchange, they would
necessarily have subjected India to a disastrous price
fluctuation comparable to that in England. Thus
the unthinking assumption, in favour of the restoration
of a fixed exchange as the one thing to aim at,
requires more examination than it sometimes receives.</p>

<p>Especially is this the case if the prospect that a
majority of countries will adopt the same standard
is still remote. When by adopting the gold standard
we could achieve stability of exchange with almost
the whole world, whilst any other standard would
have appeared as a solitary eccentricity, the solid advantages
of certainty and convenience supported the
conservative preference for gold. Nevertheless, even
so, the convenience of traders and the primitive
passion for solid metal might not, I think, have been
adequate to preserve the dynasty of gold, if it had
not been for another, half-accidental circumstance;
namely, that for many years past gold had afforded not
only a stable exchange but, on the whole, a stable price
level also. In fact, the choice between stable exchanges
and stable prices had not presented itself as an
acute dilemma. And when, prior to the development
of the South African mines, we seemed to be faced
with a continuously falling price level, the fierceness of
the bimetallic controversy testified to the discontent
provoked as soon as the existing standard appeared
seriously incompatible with the stability of prices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>Indeed, it is doubtful whether the pre-war system
for regulating the international flow of gold would
have been capable of dealing with such large or
sudden divergencies between the price levels of
different countries as have occurred lately. The fault
of the pre-war régime, under which the rates of
exchange between a country and the outside world
were fixed, and the internal price level had to adjust
itself thereto (<i>i.e.</i> was chiefly governed by external influences),
was that it was too slow and insensitive in
its mode of operation. The fault of the post-war
régime, under which the price level mainly depends on
internal influences (<i>i.e.</i> internal currency and credit
policy) and the rates of exchange with the outside
world have to adjust themselves thereto, is that it is
too rapid in its effect and over-sensitive, with the
result that it may act violently for merely transitory
causes. Nevertheless, when the fluctuations are large
and sudden, a quick reaction is necessary for the maintenance
of equilibrium; and the necessity for quick
reaction has been one of the factors which have
rendered the pre-war method inapplicable to post-war
conditions, and have made every one nervous of proclaiming
a final fixation of the exchange.</p>

<p>We are familiar with the causal chain along which
the pre-war method reached its result. If gold
flowed out of the country’s central reserves, this
modified discount policy and the creation of credit,
thus affecting the demand for, and hence the price of,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the class of goods most sensitive to the ease of credit,
and gradually, through the price of these goods,
spreading its influence to the prices of goods generally,
including those which enter into international trade,
until at the new level of price foreign goods began to
look dear at home and domestic goods cheap abroad,
and the adverse balance was redressed. But this
process might take months to work itself out. Nowadays,
the gold reserves might be dangerously
depleted before the compensating forces had time
to operate. Moreover, the movement of the rate
of interest up or down sometimes had more effect
in attracting foreign capital or encouraging investment
abroad than in influencing home prices.
Where the disequilibrium was purely seasonal, this
was an unqualified advantage; for it was much
better that foreign funds should ebb and flow between
the slack and the busy seasons than that prices should
go up and down. But where it was due to more
permanent causes, the adjustment even before the
war might be imperfect; for the stimulus to foreign
loans, whilst restoring the balance for the time being,
might obscure the real seriousness of the situation,
and enable a country to live beyond its resources
for a considerable time at the risk of ultimate
default.</p>

<p>Compare with this the instantaneous effects of
the post-war method. If at the existing rate of
exchange the amount of sterling offered in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
exchange market during the course of the morning
exceeds the amount of dollars offered, there is no gold
available for export at a fixed price to bridge the
gulf. Consequently the dollar rate of exchange must
move until at the new rate the offerings of each of
the two currencies in exchange for one another
exactly balance in amount. But it is the inevitable
result of this that within half an hour the relative
prices of commodities entering into English-American
trade, such as cotton and electrolytic copper, have
adjusted themselves accordingly. Unless the American
prices move to meet them half-way, the English
prices immediately rise correspondent to the movement
of the exchange.</p>

<p>This means that relative prices can be knocked
about by the most fleeting influences of politics and
of sentiment, and by the periodic pressure of seasonal
trades. But it also means that the post-war method
is a most rapid and powerful corrective of real disequilibria
in the balance of international payments
arising from whatever causes, and a wonderful preventive
in the way of countries which are inclined
to spend abroad beyond their resources.</p>

<p>Thus when there are violent shocks to the pre-existing
equilibrium between the internal and external
price-levels, the pre-war method is likely to break
down in practice, simply because it cannot bring about
the re-adjustment of internal prices <em>quick enough</em>.
Theoretically, of course, the pre-war method must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
be able to make itself effective sooner or later, provided
the movement of gold is allowed to continue
without restriction, until the inflation or deflation
of prices has taken place to the necessary extent.
But in practice there is usually a limit to the rate
and to the amount by which the actual currency or
the metallic backing for it can be allowed to flow
abroad. If the supply of money or credit is reduced
faster than social and business arrangements allow
prices to fall, intolerable inconveniences result.
Perhaps some of the incidents of debasement of the
coinage which are sprinkled through the currency
history of the late Middle Ages were really due to
a similar cause. Prior to the discovery of the New
World the precious metals were, over a long period,
becoming progressively scarcer in Europe through
natural wastage in the absence of adequate new
supplies, and the drain to the East; with the result
that from time to time the price level in England
(for example) would be established on too high a
level in relation to European prices. The resulting
tendency of silver to flow abroad, being accentuated
perhaps by some special temporary cause, would
give rise to complaints of a “scarcity of currency,”
which really means an outflow of money faster
than social organisation permits prices to fall. No
doubt some of the debasements were helped by
the fact that they profited incidentally a necessitous
Exchequer. But they may have been, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the best available expedient for meeting the currency
problem.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">47</a> We shall look on Edward III.’s debasements
of sterling money with a more tolerant eye
if we regard them as a method of carrying into effect
a preference for stability of internal prices over
stability of external exchanges, celebrating that
monarch as an enlightened forerunner of Professor
Irving Fisher in advocacy of the “compensated
dollar,” only more happy than the latter in his
opportunities to carry theory into practice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>The reader should notice, further, the different
parts played by discount policy under the one régime
and under the other. With the pre-war method
discount policy is a vital part of the process for
restoring equilibrium between internal and external
prices. With the post-war method it is not equally
indispensable, since the fluctuation of the exchanges
can bring about equilibrium without its aid;—though
it remains, of course, as an instrument for
influencing the internal price level and through this
the exchanges, if we desire to establish either the
one or the other at a different level from that which
would have prevailed otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="sec_14">III. <i>The Restoration of a Gold Standard.</i></h3>

<p>Our conclusions up to this point are, therefore,
that, when stability of the internal price level and
stability of the external exchanges are incompatible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the former is generally preferable; and that on occasions
when the dilemma is acute, the preservation of
the former at the expense of the latter is, fortunately
perhaps, the line of least resistance.</p>

<p>The restoration of the gold standard (whether at
the pre-war parity or at some other rate) certainly
will not give us complete stability of internal prices
and can only give us complete stability of the external
exchanges if all other countries also restore the gold
standard. The advisability of restoring it depends,
therefore, on whether, on the whole, it will give us
the best working compromise obtainable between the
two ideals.</p>

<p>The advocates of gold, as against a more scientific
standard, base their cause on the double contention,
that in practice gold has provided and will provide
a reasonably stable standard of value, and that in
practice, since governing authorities lack wisdom as
often as not, a managed currency will, sooner or later,
come to grief. Conservatism and scepticism join
arms—as they often do. Perhaps superstition comes
in too; for gold still enjoys the prestige of its smell
and colour.</p>

<p>The considerable success with which gold maintained
its stability of value in the changing world of
the nineteenth century was certainly remarkable. I
have applauded it in the first chapter. After the
discoveries of Australia and California it began to
depreciate dangerously, and before the exploitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
of South Africa it began to appreciate dangerously.
Yet in each case it righted itself and retained its
reputation.</p>

<p>But the conditions of the future are not those of
the past. We have no sufficient ground for expecting
the continuance of the special conditions which
preserved a sort of balance before the war. For what
are the underlying explanations of the good behaviour
of gold during the nineteenth century?</p>

<p>In the first place, it happened that progress in
the discovery of gold mines roughly kept pace with
progress in other directions—a correspondence which
was not altogether a matter of chance, because the
progress of that period, since it was characterised by
the gradual opening up and exploitation of the world’s
surface, not unnaturally brought to light <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pari passu</i>
the remoter deposits of gold. But this stage of history
is now almost at an end. A quarter of a century
has passed by since the discovery of an important
deposit. Material progress is more dependent now
on the growth of scientific and technical knowledge,
of which the application to gold-mining may be
intermittent. Years may elapse without great improvement
in the methods of extracting gold; and
then the genius of a chemist may realise past dreams
and forgotten hoaxes, transmuting base into precious
like Subtle, or extracting gold from sea-water as in
the Bubble. Gold is liable to be either too dear or
too cheap. In either case, it is too much to expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
that a succession of accidents will keep the metal
steady.</p>

<p>But there was another type of influence which
used to aid stability. The value of gold has not
depended on the policy or the decisions of a single
body of men; and a sufficient proportion of the
supply has been able to find its way, without any
flooding of the market, into the Arts or into the
hoards of Asia for its marginal value to be governed
by a steady psychological estimation of the metal in
relation to other things. This is what is meant by
saying that gold has “intrinsic value” and is free
from the dangers of a “managed” currency. The
<em>independent variety</em> of the influences determining the
value of gold has been in itself a steadying influence.
The arbitrary and variable character of the proportion
of gold reserves to liabilities maintained by many of
the note-issuing banks of the world, so far from
introducing an incalculable factor, was an element
of stability. For when gold was relatively abundant
and flowed towards them, it was absorbed by their
allowing their ratio of gold reserves to rise slightly;
and when it was relatively scarce, the fact that they
had no intention of ever utilising their gold reserves
for any practical purpose, permitted most of them to
view with equanimity a moderate weakening of their
proportion. A great part of the flow of South African
gold between the end of the Boer War and 1914
was able to find its way into the central gold reserves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
of European and other countries with the minimum
effect on prices.</p>

<p>But the war has effected a great change. Gold
itself has become a “managed” currency. The West,
as well as the East, has learnt to hoard gold; but
the motives of the United States are not those of
India. Now that most countries have abandoned
the gold standard, the supply of the metal would,
if the chief user of it restricted its holdings to its real
needs, prove largely redundant. The United States
has not been able to let gold fall to its “natural”
value, because it could not face the resulting depreciation
of its standard. It has been driven, therefore,
to the costly policy of burying in the vaults of
Washington what the miners of the Rand have
laboriously brought to the surface. Consequently
gold now stands at an “artificial” value, the future
course of which almost entirely depends on the policy
of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States.
The value of gold is no longer the resultant of the
chance gifts of Nature and the judgment of numerous
authorities and individuals acting independently.
Even if other countries gradually return to a gold
basis, the position will not be greatly changed. The
tendency to employ some variant of the gold-exchange
standard and the probably permanent disappearance
of gold from the pockets of the people are likely to
mean that the strictly <em>necessary</em> gold reserves of the
Central Banks of the gold-standard countries will fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
considerably short of the available supplies. The
actual value of gold will depend, therefore, on the
policy of three or four of the most powerful Central
Banks, whether they act independently or in unison.
If, on the other hand, pre-war conventions about the
use of gold in reserves and in circulation were to be
restored—which is, in my opinion, the much less
probable alternative—there might be, as Professor
Cassel has predicted, a serious shortage of gold
leading to a progressive appreciation in its value.</p>

<p>Nor must we neglect the possibility of a partial
demonetisation of gold by the United States through
a closing of its mints to further receipts of gold.
The present policy of the United States in accepting
unlimited imports of gold can be justified, perhaps,
as a temporary measure, intended to preserve tradition
and to strengthen confidence through a transitional
period. But, looked at as a permanent arrangement,
it could hardly be judged otherwise than as a foolish
expense. If the Federal Reserve Board intends to
maintain the value of the dollar at a level which is
irrespective of the inflow or outflow of gold, what
object is there in continuing to accept at the mints
gold which is not wanted, yet costs a heavy price?
If the United States mints were to be closed to gold,
everything, except the actual price of the metal,
could continue precisely as before.</p>

<p>Confidence in the future stability of the value of
gold depends therefore on the United States being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
foolish enough to go on accepting gold which it does
not want, and wise enough, having accepted it, to
maintain it at a fixed value. This double event
might be realised through the collaboration of a public
understanding nothing with a Federal Reserve Board
understanding everything. But the position is precarious;
and not very attractive to any country
which is still in a position to choose what its future
standard is to be.</p>

<p>This discussion of the prospects of the stability
of gold has partly answered by anticipation the second
principal argument in favour of the restoration of an
unqualified gold standard, namely that this is the
only way of avoiding the dangers of a “managed”
currency.</p>

<p>It is natural, after what we have experienced, that
prudent people should desiderate a standard of value
which is independent of Finance Ministers and State
Banks. The present state of affairs has allowed to
the ignorance and frivolity of statesmen an ample
opportunity of bringing about ruinous consequences
in the economic field. It is felt that the general
level of economic and financial education amongst
statesmen and bankers is hardly such as to render
innovations feasible or safe; that, in fact, a chief
object of stabilising the exchanges is to strap down
Ministers of Finance.</p>

<p>These are reasonable grounds of hesitation. But
the experience on which they are based is by no means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
fair to the capacities of statesmen and bankers. The
non-metallic standards, of which we have experience,
have been anything rather than scientific experiments
coolly carried out. They have been a last resort,
involuntarily adopted, as a result of war or inflationary
taxation, when the State finances were already broken
or the situation out of hand. Naturally in these
circumstances such practices have been the accompaniment
and the prelude of disaster. But we
cannot argue from this to what can be achieved in
normal times. I do not see that the regulation of the
standard of value is essentially more difficult than
many other objects of less social necessity which we
attain successfully.</p>

<p>If, indeed, a providence watched over gold, or if
Nature had provided us with a stable standard ready-made,
I would not, in an attempt after some slight
improvement, hand over the management to the
possible weakness or ignorance of Boards and Governments.
But this is not the situation. We have no
ready-made standard. Experience has shown that
in emergencies Ministers of Finance cannot be strapped
down. And—most important of all—in the modern
world of paper currency and bank credit there is no
escape from a “managed” currency, whether we
wish it or not;—convertibility into gold will not alter
the fact that the value of gold itself depends on the
policy of the Central Banks.</p>

<p>It is worth while to pause a moment over the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
sentence. It differs significantly from the doctrine
of gold reserves which we learnt and taught before
the war. We used to assume that no Central Bank
would be so extravagant as to keep more gold than
it required or so imprudent as to keep less. From
time to time gold would flow out into the circulation
or for export abroad; experience showed that the
quantity required on these occasions bore some rough
proportion to the Central Bank’s liabilities; a
decidedly higher proportion than this would be fixed
on to provide for contingencies and to inspire confidence;
and the creation of credit would be regulated
largely by reference to the maintenance of this
proportion. The Bank of England, for example,
would allow itself to be swayed by the tides of gold,
permitting the inflowing and outflowing streams to
produce their “natural” consequences unchecked by
any ideas as to preventing the effect on prices.
Already before the war, the system was becoming
precarious by reason of its artificiality. The “proportion”
was by the lapse of time losing its relation
to the facts and had become largely conventional.
Some other figure, greater or less, would have done
just as well.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">48</a> The War broke down the convention;
for the withdrawal of gold from actual circulation
destroyed one of the elements of reality lying behind
the convention, and the suspension of convertibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
destroyed the other. It would have been absurd to
regulate the bank rate by reference to a “proportion”
which had lost all its significance; and in the course
of the past ten years a new policy has been evolved.
The bank rate is now employed, however incompletely
and experimentally, to regulate the expansion and
deflation of credit in the interests of business stability
and the steadiness of prices. In so far as it is employed
to procure stability of the dollar exchange, where this
is inconsistent with stability of internal prices, we
have a relic of pre-war policy and a compromise
between discrepant aims.</p>

xxiv. p. 621.</p>

</div>

<p>Those who advocate the return to a gold standard
do not always appreciate along what different lines
our actual practice has been drifting. If we restore
the gold standard, are we to return also to the pre-war
conceptions of bank-rate, allowing the tides of gold
to play what tricks they like with the internal price-level,
and abandoning the attempt to moderate the
disastrous influence of the credit-cycle on the stability
of prices and employment? Or are we to continue
and develop the experimental innovations of our
present policy, ignoring the “bank ratio” and, if
necessary, allowing unmoved a piling up of gold
reserves far beyond our requirements or their depletion
far below them?</p>

<p>In truth, the gold standard is already a barbarous
relic. All of us, from the Governor of the Bank of
England downwards, are now primarily interested in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
preserving the stability of business, prices, and employment,
and are not likely, when the choice is
forced on us, deliberately to sacrifice these to the out-worn
dogma, which had its value once, of £3 : 17 : 10½
per ounce. Advocates of the ancient standard do
not observe how remote it now is from the spirit and
the requirements of the age. A regulated non-metallic
standard has slipped in unnoticed. <em>It
exists.</em> Whilst the economists dozed, the academic
dream of a hundred years, doffing its cap and
gown, clad in paper rags, has crept into the real
world by means of the bad fairies—always so much
more potent than the good—the wicked Ministers of
Finance.</p>

<p>For these reasons enlightened advocates of the
restoration of gold, such as Mr. Hawtrey, do not
welcome it as the return of a “natural” currency,
and intend, quite decidedly, that it shall be a
“managed” one. They allow gold back only as a
constitutional monarch, shorn of his ancient despotic
powers and compelled to accept the advice of a
Parliament of Banks. The adoption of the ideas
present in the minds of those who drafted the Genoa
Resolutions on Currency is an essential condition of
Mr. Hawtrey’s adherence to gold. He contemplates
“the practice of continuous co-operation among central
banks of issue” (Res. 3), and an international convention,
based on a gold exchange standard, and designed
“with a view to preventing undue fluctuations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
in the purchasing power of gold” (Res. 11).<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">49</a> But
he is <em>not</em> in favour of resuming the gold standard
irrespective of “whether the difficulties in regard to
the future purchasing power of gold have been
provided against or not.” “It is not easy,” he
admits, “to promote international action, and should
it fail, the wisest course for the time being might be
to concentrate on the stabilisation of sterling in terms
of commodities, rather than tie the pound to a metal,
the vagaries of which cannot be foreseen.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is natural to ask, in face of advocacy of this
kind, why it is necessary to drag in gold at all.
Mr. Hawtrey lays no stress on the obvious support
for his compromise, namely the force of sentiment
and tradition, and the preference of Englishmen for
shearing a monarch of his powers rather than of his
head. But he adduces three other reasons: (1) that
gold is required as a liquid reserve for the settlement
of international balances of indebtedness; (2) that
it enables an experiment to be made without cutting
adrift from the old system; and (3) that the vested
interests of gold producers must be considered. These
objects, however, are so largely attained by my own
suggestions in the following chapter, that I need not
dwell on them here.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I see grave objections to
reinstating gold in the pious hope that international
co-operation will keep it in order. With the existing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
distribution of the world’s gold, the reinstatement of
the gold standard means, inevitably, that we surrender
the regulation of our price level and the handling of
the credit cycle to the Federal Reserve Board of the
United States. Even if the most intimate and cordial
co-operation is established between the Board and the
Bank of England, the preponderance of power will
still belong to the former. The Board will be in a
position to disregard the Bank. But if the Bank
disregard the Board, it will render itself liable to be
flooded with, or depleted of, gold, as the case may be.
Moreover, we can be confident beforehand that there
will be much suspicion amongst Americans (for that
is their disposition) of any supposed attempt on the
part of the Bank of England to dictate their policy
or to influence American discount rates in the interests
of Great Britain. We must also be prepared to incur
our share of the vain expense of bottling up the world’s
redundant gold.</p>

<p>It would be rash in present circumstances to
surrender our freedom of action to the Federal
Reserve Board of the United States. We do not yet
possess sufficient experience of its capacity to act in
times of stress with courage and independence. The
Federal Reserve Board is striving to free itself from
the pressure of sectional interests; but we are not
yet certain that it will wholly succeed. It is still liable
to be overwhelmed by the impetuosity of a cheap
money campaign. A suspicion of British influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
would, so far from strengthening the Board, greatly
weaken its resistance to popular clamour. Nor is it
certain, quite apart from weakness or mistakes, that
the simultaneous application of the same policy will
always be in the interests of both countries. The
development of the credit cycle and the state of
business may sometimes be widely different on the
two sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Therefore, since I regard the stability of prices,
credit, and employment as of paramount importance,
and since I feel no confidence that an old-fashioned
gold standard will even give us the modicum of
stability that it used to give, I reject the policy of
restoring the gold standard on pre-war lines. At the
same time I doubt the wisdom of attempting a
“managed” gold standard jointly with the United
States, on the lines recommended by Mr. Hawtrey,
because it retains too many of the disadvantages of
the old system without its advantages, and because
it would make us too dependent on the policy and
on the wishes of the Federal Reserve Board.</p>

<span class="subhead">POSITIVE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
REGULATION OF MONEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">A sound</span> constructive scheme must provide—if it is
to satisfy the arguments and the analysis of this book:</p>

<p>I. A method for regulating the supply of currency
and credit with a view to maintaining, so far as
possible, the stability of the internal price level; and</p>

<p>II. A method for regulating the supply of foreign
exchange so as to avoid purely temporary fluctuations,
caused by seasonal or other influences and not due
to a lasting disturbance in the relation between the
internal and the external price level.</p>

<p>I believe that in Great Britain the ideal system
can be most nearly and most easily reached by an
adaptation of the actual system which has grown up,
half haphazard, since the war. After the general
idea has been exhibited by an application in detail
to the case of Great Britain, it will be sufficient to
deal somewhat briefly with the modifications required
in the case of other countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_15">I. <i>Great Britain.</i></h3>

<p>The system actually in operation to-day is broadly
as follows:</p>

<p>(1) The internal price level is mainly determined
by the amount of credit created by the banks, chiefly
the Big Five; though in a depression, when the
public are increasing their real balances, a greater
amount of credit has to be created to support a given
price level (in accordance with the theory explained
above in Chapter III., <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>) than is required in a
boom, when real balances are being diminished.</p>

<p>The amount of credit, so created, is in its turn
roughly measured by the volume of the banks’
deposits—since variations in this total must correspond
to variations in the total of their investments,
bill-holdings, and advances. Now there is no necessary
reason <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> why the proportion between the
banks’ deposits and their “cash in hand and at the
Bank of England” should not fluctuate within fairly
wide limits in accordance with circumstances. But
in practice the banks usually work by rule of thumb
and do not depart widely from their preconceived
“proportions.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">51</a> In recent times their aggregate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
deposits have always been about nine times their
“cash.” Since this is what is generally considered a
“safe” proportion, it is bad for a bank’s reputation
to fall below it, whilst on the other hand it is bad for
its earning power to rise above it. Thus in one way
or another the banks generally adjust their total
creation of credit in one form or another (investments,
bills, and advances) up to their capacity as
measured by the above criterion; from which it
follows that the volume of their “cash” in the shape
of Bank and Currency Notes and Deposits at the
Bank of England closely determines the volume of
credit which they create.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="fnanchor">51</a> The Joint Stock banks have published monthly returns since January
1921. Excluding the half-yearly statement when a little “window-dressing”
is temporarily arranged, the extreme range of fluctuation has been between
11·0 per cent and 11·9 per cent in the proportion of “cash” to deposits,
and between 41·1 per cent and 50·1 per cent in the proportion of advances
to deposits. These figures cover two and a half years of widely varying
conditions. The “proportions” of individual banks differ amongst themselves,
and the above is an average result, the steadiness of which is strengthened
by the fact that each big bank is pretty steadfast in its own policy.</p>

</div>

<p>In order to follow, therefore, the train of causation
a stage further, we must consider what determines
the volume of their “cash.” Its amount can only
be altered in one or other of three ways: (<i>a</i>) by the
public requiring more or fewer notes in circulation,
(<i>b</i>) by the Treasury borrowing more or less from the
Currency Note Reserve, and (<i>c</i>) by the Bank of
England increasing or diminishing its assets.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="fnanchor">52</a> For the aggregate of its liabilities in the shape of deposits and of notes
in circulation automatically depends on the volume of its assets.</p>

</div>

<p>To complete the argument, one further factor, not
yet mentioned, must be introduced, namely (<i>d</i>) the
proportion of the banks’ second-line reserve in the
shape of their holdings of Treasury Bills, which can
be regarded as cash at one remove. In determining
what is a safe proportion of “cash,” they pay some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
regard to the amount of Treasury Bills which they
hold, since by reducing this holding they can immediately
increase their “cash” and compel the
Treasury to borrow more either from the Currency
Note Reserve or from the Bank of England. The
ninefold proportion referred to above presumes a
certain minimum holding of Treasury Bills, and
might have to be modified if a sufficient volume of
such Bills was not available. This factor (<i>d</i>) is,
however, also important because the banks in their
turn are open to pressure by the Treasury, whenever
it draws to itself the resources of their depositors—whether
by taxation or by offering them attractive
longer-dated loans—and uses them to pay off, if not
Ways and Means advances from the Bank of England
(which reduces the banks’ first-line reserve of cash),
then alternatively Treasury Bills held by the banks
themselves (which reduces their second-line reserve
of bills).</p>

<p>Items (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), and (<i>d</i>) together, therefore, more
or less settle the matter. For the purpose of the
present argument, however, we need not pay much
separate attention to (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), since their effect is,
for the most part, reflected over again in (<i>c</i>) and
(<i>d</i>). (<i>a</i>) depends partly on the volume of trade but
mainly on the price level itself; and in practice
fluctuations in (<i>a</i>) do not <em>directly</em> affect the banks’
“cash,”—for if more notes are required under (<i>a</i>),
more notes are issued, the Treasury borrowing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
corresponding additional amount from the Currency
Note Reserve, in which case the Treasury either
repays the Bank of England, which diminishes the
Bank’s assets and consequently the other banks’
“cash,” or withdraws an equivalent amount of
Treasury Bills, which diminishes the other banks’
second-line reserve; <i>i.e.</i> a change in (<i>a</i>) operates on
the banks’ resources through (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>).<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">53</a> Whilst as
for (<i>b</i>), a change in the amount of what the Treasury
borrows from the Currency Note Reserve is reflected
by a corresponding change in the opposite sense in
what it borrows in Ways and Means Advances or
in Treasury Bills.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="fnanchor">53</a> If the additional issue of notes is covered by transferring gold from the
Bank of England, this is merely an alternative way of diminishing the Bank
of England’s assets.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus we can concentrate our attention on (<i>c</i>) and
(<i>d</i>) as the main determining factors of the price level.</p>

<p>Now (<i>c</i>), namely the assets of the Bank of England,
consist (so far as their variable part is concerned) of</p>

<table id="t181" summary="Assets of the Bank of England">
<tr>
  <td class="tdr">(i.)</td>
  <td class="tdl">Ways and Means advances to the Treasury.</td>

<tr>
  <td class="tdr">(ii.)</td>
  <td class="tdl">Gilt-edged and other investments.</td>

<tr>
  <td class="tdr">(iii.)</td>
  <td class="tdl">Advances to its customers and bills of exchange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdr">(iv.)</td>
  <td class="tdl">Gold.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="in0">An increase in any of these items tends, therefore, to
increase the other banks’ “cash,” thereby to stimulate
the creation of credit, and hence to raise the price
level; and contrariwise.</p>

<p>And (<i>d</i>), namely the banks’ holdings of Treasury
Bills, depend on the excess of the expenditure of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
Treasury over and above what it secures (i.) from
the public by taxation and loans, (ii.) from the Bank
of England in Ways and Means advances, and (iii.) by
borrowing from the Currency Note Reserve.</p>

<p>It follows that the capacity of the Joint Stock
banks to create credit is mainly governed by the
policies and actions of the Bank of England and of
the Treasury. When these are settled, (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>),
and (<i>d</i>) are settled.</p>

<p>How far can these two authorities control their
own actions and how far must they remain passive
agents? In my opinion the control, if they choose
to exercise it, is mainly in their own hands. As
regards the Treasury, the extent to which they draw
money from the public to discharge floating debt
clearly depends on the rate of interest and the type
of loan which they are prepared to offer. A point
might be reached when they could not fund further
on any reasonable terms; but within fairly wide
limits the policy of the Treasury can be whatever the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the House of Commons
may decide. The Bank of England also is, within
sufficiently wide limits, mistress of the situation if
she acts in conjunction with the Treasury. She can
increase or decrease at will her investments and
her gold by buying or selling the one or the other.
In the case of advances and of bills, whilst their
volume is not so immediately or directly controllable,
here also adequate control can be obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
by varying the price charged, that is to say the bank
rate.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_59" href="#FNanchor_59" class="fnanchor">54</a> It is often assumed that the bank rate is the <em>sole</em> governing factor.
But the bank rate can only operate by its reaction on (<i>c</i>), namely, the Bank
of England’s assets. Formerly it acted pretty directly on two of the components
of (<i>c</i>), namely, (<i>c</i>) (iii.) advances to customers and bills of exchange
and (<i>c</i>) (iv.) gold. Now it acts only on one of them, namely, (<i>c</i>) (iii.). But
changes in (<i>c</i>) (i.) the Bank’s advances to the Treasury and (<i>c</i>) (ii.) the Bank’s
investments can often be nearly as potent in their effect on the creation of
credit. Thus a low bank rate can be largely neutralised by a simultaneous
reduction of (<i>c</i>) (i.) or (<i>c</i>) (ii.) and a high bank rate by an increase of these.
Indeed the Bank of England can probably bring the money-market to heel
more decisively by buying or selling securities than in any other way;
and the utility of bank rate, operated by itself and without assistance from
deliberate variations in the volume of (<i>c</i>) (ii.), is lessened by the various
limitations which exist in practice to its freedom of movement, and to the
limits within which it can move, upwards and downwards.</p>

</div>

<p>Therefore it is broadly true to say that the level
of prices, and hence the level of the exchanges,
depends in the last resort on the policy of the Bank
of England and of the Treasury in respect of the above
particulars;—though the other banks, if they strongly
opposed the official policy, could thwart, or at least
delay it to a certain extent—provided they were
prepared to depart from their usual proportions.</p>

<p>(2) Cash, in the form of Bank or Currency Notes,
is supplied <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad libitum</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in such quantities as are
called for by the amount of credit created and the
internal price level established under (1). That is
to say, in practice;—in theory, a limit to the issue
of Currency Notes has been laid down, namely the
maximum fiduciary issue actually attained in the
preceding calendar year. Since this theoretical maximum
was prescribed, it has never yet been actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
operative; and, as the rule springs from a doctrine
now out of date and out of accordance with most
responsible opinion, it is probable that, if it were
becoming operative, it would be relaxed. This is
a matter where the recommendations of the Cunliffe
Committee call for urgent change, unless we desire
deliberately to pursue still further a process of Deflation.
A point must come when, a year of brisk trade
and employment following one of depression, there
will be an increased demand for currency, which
must be met unless the revival is to be deliberately
damped down.</p>

<p>Thus the tendency of to-day—rightly I think—is
to watch and to control the creation of credit
and to let the creation of currency follow suit, rather
than, as formerly, to watch and to control the creation
of currency and to let the creation of credit follow suit.</p>

<p>(3) The Bank of England’s gold is immobilised.
It neither buys nor sells. The gold plays no part in
our system. Occasionally, however, the Bank may
ship a consignment to the United States, to help the
Treasury in meeting its dollar liabilities. The South
African and other gold which finds its way here comes
purely as a commodity to a convenient <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrepôt</i> centre,
and is mostly re-exported.</p>

<p>(4) The foreign exchanges are unregulated and
left to look after themselves. From day to day
they fluctuate in accordance with the seasons and
other irregular influences. Over longer periods they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
depend, as we have seen, on the relative price levels
established here and abroad by the respective credit
policies adopted here and abroad. But whilst this
is, for the most part, the actual state of affairs, it
is not, as yet, the avowed or consistent policy of the
responsible authorities. Fixity of the dollar exchange
at the pre-war parity remains their aspiration; and
it still may happen that the bank rate is raised for
the purpose of influencing the exchange at a time
when considerations of internal price level and credit
policy point the other way.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>This, in brief—I apologise to the reader if I have
compressed the argument unduly—is the present
state of affairs, one essentially different from our
pre-war system. It will be observed that in practice
we have already gone a long way towards the ideal
of directing bank rate and credit policy by reference
to the internal price level and other symptoms of
under- or over-expansion of internal credit, rather
than by reference to the pre-war criteria of the
amount of cash in circulation (or of gold reserves in
the banks) or the level of the dollar exchange.</p>

<p>I. Accordingly my first requirement in a good
constructive scheme can be supplied merely by a
development of our existing arrangements on more
deliberate and self-conscious lines. Hitherto the
Treasury and the Bank of England have looked
forward to the stability of the dollar exchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
(preferably at the pre-war parity) as their objective.
It is not clear whether they intend to stick to this
irrespective of fluctuations in the value of the dollar
(or of gold); whether, that is to say, they would
sacrifice the stability of sterling prices to the stability
of the dollar exchange in the event of the two proving
to be incompatible. At any rate, my scheme would
require that they should adopt the stability of sterling
prices as their <em>primary</em> objective—though this would
not prevent their aiming at exchange stability also
as a secondary objective by co-operating with the
Federal Reserve Board in a common policy. So long
as the Federal Reserve Board was successful in keeping
dollar prices steady the objective of keeping sterling
prices steady would be identical with the objective
of keeping the dollar sterling exchange steady. My
recommendation does not involve more than a determination
that, in the event of the Federal Reserve
Board failing to keep dollar prices steady, sterling
prices should not, if it could be helped, plunge with
them merely for the sake of maintaining a fixed
parity of exchange.</p>

<p>If the Bank of England, the Treasury, and the
Big Five were to adopt this policy, to what criteria
should they look respectively in regulating bank-rate,
Government borrowing, and trade-advances?
The first question is whether the criterion should be
a precise, arithmetical formula or whether it should
be sought in a general judgement of the situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
based on all the available data. The pioneer of price-stability
as against exchange-stability, Professor
Irving Fisher, advocated the former in the shape
of his “compensated dollar,” which was to be automatically
adjusted by reference to an index number
of prices without any play of judgement or discretion.
He may have been influenced, however, by the
advantage of propounding a method which could
be grafted as easily as possible on to the pre-war
system of gold-reserves and gold-ratios. In any case,
I doubt the wisdom and the practicability of a
system so cut and dried. If we wait until a price
movement is actually afoot before applying remedial
measures, we may be too late. “It is not the <em>past</em>
rise in prices but the <em>future</em> rise that has to be counteracted.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">55</a>
It is characteristic of the impetuosity of
the credit cycle that price movements tend to be
cumulative, each movement promoting, up to a
certain point, a further movement in the same
direction. Professor Fisher’s method may be adapted
to deal with long-period trends in the value of gold
but not with the, often more injurious, short-period
oscillations of the credit cycle. Nevertheless, whilst
it would not be advisable to postpone action until
it was called for by an actual movement of prices,
it would promote confidence and furnish an objective
standard of value, if, an official index number having
been compiled of such a character as to register the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
price of a standard composite commodity, the authorities
were to adopt this composite commodity as their
standard of value in the sense that they would employ
all their resources to prevent a movement of its
price by more than a certain percentage in either
direction away from the normal, just as before the
war they employed all their resources to prevent a
movement in the price of gold by more than a
certain percentage. The precise composition of the
standard composite commodity could be modified
from time to time in accordance with changes in
the relative economic importance of its various
components.</p>

</div>

<p>As regards the criteria, other than the actual
trend of prices, which should determine the action of
the controlling authority, it is beyond the scope of
this volume to deal adequately with the diagnosis
and analysis of the credit cycle. The more deeply
that our researches penetrate into this subject,
the more accurately shall we understand the right
time and method for controlling credit-expansion by
bank-rate or otherwise. But in the meantime we
have a considerable and growing body of general
experience upon which those in authority can base
their judgements. Actual price-movements must of
course provide the most important datum; but
the state of employment, the volume of production,
the effective demand for credit as felt by the banks,
the rate of interest on investments of various types,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
the volume of new issues, the flow of cash into
circulation, the statistics of foreign trade and the
level of the exchanges must all be taken into account.
The main point is that the <em>objective</em> of the authorities,
pursued with such means as are at their command,
should be the stability of prices.</p>

<p>It would at least be possible to avoid, for example,
such action as has been taken lately (in Great Britain)
whereby the supply of “cash” has been deflated at
a time when real balances were becoming inflated,—action
which has materially aggravated the severity
of the late depression. We might be able to moderate
very greatly the amplitude of the fluctuations if it
was understood that the time to deflate the supply
of cash is when real balances are falling, <i>i.e.</i> when
prices are rising out of proportion to the increase, if
any, in the volume of cash, and that the time to
inflate the supply of cash is when real balances are
rising, and not, as seems to be our present practice,
the other way round.</p>

<p>II. How can we best combine this primary object
with a maximum stability of the exchanges? Can
we get the best of both worlds—stability of prices
over long periods and stability of exchanges over
short periods? It is the great advantage of the gold
standard that it overcomes the excessive sensitiveness
of the exchanges to temporary influences, which we
analysed in Chapter III. Our object must be to
secure this advantage, if we can, without committing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
ourselves to follow big movements in the value of
gold itself.</p>

<p>I believe that we can go a long way in this direction
if the Bank of England will take over the duty of
regulating the price of gold, just as it already regulates
the rate of discount. “Regulate,” but not “peg.”
The Bank of England should have a buying and a
selling price for gold, just as it did before the war,
and this price might remain unchanged for considerable
periods, just as bank-rate does. But it would not
be fixed or “pegged” once and for all, any more
than bank-rate is fixed. The Bank’s rate for gold
would be announced every Thursday morning at the
same time as its rate for discounting bills, with a
difference between its buying and selling rates corresponding
to the pre-war margin between £3 : 17 : 10½
per oz. and £3 : 17 : 9 per oz.; except that, in order
to obviate too frequent changes in the rate, the
difference might be wider than 1½d. per oz.—say, ½
to 1 per cent. A willingness on the part of the Bank
both to buy and to sell gold at rates fixed for the
time being would keep the dollar-sterling exchange
steady within corresponding limits, so that the exchange
rate would not move with every breath of
wind but only when the Bank had come to a considered
judgement that a change was required for the
sake of the stability of sterling prices.</p>

<p>If the bank rate and the gold rate in conjunction
were leading to an excessive influx or an excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
efflux of gold, the Bank of England would have to
decide whether the flow was due to an internal or
to an external movement away from stability. To
fix our ideas, let us suppose that gold is flowing
outwards. If this seemed to be due to a tendency
of sterling to depreciate in terms of commodities,
the correct remedy would be to raise the bank rate.
If, on the other hand, it was due to a tendency of
gold to appreciate in terms of commodities, the
correct remedy would be to raise the gold rate (<i>i.e.</i>
the buying price for gold). If, however, the flow
could be explained by seasonal, or other passing
influences, then it should be allowed to continue
(assuming, of course, that the Bank’s gold reserves
were equal to any probable calls on them) unchecked,
to be redressed later on by the corresponding reaction.</p>

<p>Two subsidiary suggestions may be made for
strengthening the Bank’s control:</p>

<p>(1) The service of the American debt will make
it necessary for the British Treasury to buy nearly
$500,000 every working day. It is clear that the
particular method adopted for purchasing these huge
sums will greatly affect the short-period fluctuations
of the exchange. I suggest that this duty should be
entrusted to the Bank of England to be carried out
by them with the express object of minimising
those fluctuations in the exchange which are due to
the daily and seasonal ebb and flow of the ordinary
trade demand. In particular the proper distribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
of these purchases through the year might be so
arranged as greatly to mitigate the normal seasonal
fluctuation discussed in Chapter III. If the trade
demand is concentrated in one half of the year the
Treasury demand should be concentrated in the other
half.</p>

<p>(2) It would effect an improvement in the technique
of the system here proposed, without altering its
fundamental characteristics, if the Bank of England
were to quote a daily price, not only for the purchase
and sale of gold for immediate delivery, but also for
delivery three months forward. The difference, if
any, between the cash and forward quotations might
represent either a discount or a premium of the latter
on the former, according as the bank desired money
rates in London to stand below or above those in
New York. The existence of the forward quotation
of the Bank of England would afford a firm foundation
for a free market in forward exchange, and would
facilitate the movement of funds between London
and New York for short periods, in much the same
way as before the war, whilst at the same time
keeping down to a minimum the actual movement
of gold bullion backwards and forwards. I need
not develop this point further, because it is only
an application of the argument of Section III. of
Chapter III. which will be most readily intelligible
to the reader, if he will refer back to the previous
argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>There remains the question of the regulation of
the Note Issue. My proposal here may appear
shocking until the reader realises that, apart from its
disregarding the conventions, it does not differ in
substance from the existing state of affairs. The
object of fixing the amount of gold to be held against
a note issue is to set up a danger signal which cannot
be easily disregarded, when a curtailment of credit
and purchasing power is urgently required to maintain
the legal tender money at its lawful parity. But
this system, whilst far better than no system at all,
is primitive in its ideas and is, in fact, a survival of
an earlier evolutionary stage in the development
of credit and currency. For it has two great disadvantages.
In so far as we fix a minimum gold
reserve against the note issue, the effect is to immobilise
this quantity of gold and thus to reduce the
amount actually available for use as a store of value
to meet temporary or sudden deficits in the country’s
international balance of payments. And in so far
as we regard an approach towards the prescribed
minimum or a departure upwards from it as a
barometer warning us to curtail credit or encouraging
us to expand it, we are using a criterion which most
people would now agree in considering second-rate
for the purpose, because it cannot give the necessary
warning <em>soon enough</em>. If gold movements are actually
taking place, this means that the disequilibrium has
proceeded a very long way; and whilst this criterion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
may pull us up in time to preserve convertibility on
the one hand or to prevent an excessive flood of
gold on the other, it will not do so in time to avoid
an injurious oscillation of prices. This method
belongs indeed to a period when the preservation
of convertibility was all that any one thought about
(all indeed that there was to think about so long as
we were confined to an unregulated gold standard),
and before the idea of utilising bank-rate as a means
of keeping prices and employment steady had become
practical politics.</p>

<p>We have scarcely realised how far our thoughts
have travelled during the past five years. But to
re-read the famous Cunliffe Report on Currency and
Foreign Exchange after the War, published in 1918,
brings vividly before one’s mind what a great distance
we have covered since then. This document was
published three months before the Armistice. It was
compiled long before the unpegging of sterling and the
great break in the European exchanges in 1919,
before the tremendous boom and crash of 1920–21,
before the vast piling up of the world’s gold in America,
and without experience of the Federal Reserve policy
in 1922–23 of burying this gold at Washington, withdrawing
it from the exercise of its full effect on
prices, and thereby, in effect, demonetising the metal.
The Cunliffe Report is an unadulterated pre-war
prescription—inevitably so considering that it was
written after four years’ interregnum of war, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Peace was in sight, and without knowledge of the
revolutionary and unforeseeable experiences of the
past five years.</p>

<p>Of all the omissions from the Cunliffe Report the
most noteworthy is the complete absence of any
mention of the problem of the stability of the price-level;
and it cheerfully explains how the pre-war
system, which it aims at restoring, operated to bring
back equilibrium by deliberately causing a “consequent
slackening of employment.” The Cunliffe
Report belongs to an extinct and an almost forgotten
order of ideas. Few think on these lines now; yet
the Report remains the authorised declaration of our
policy, and the Bank of England and the Treasury are
said still to regard it as their marching orders.</p>

<p>Let us return to the regulation of note issue.
If we agree that gold is not to be employed in the
circulation, and that it is better to employ some
other criterion than the ratio of gold reserves to note
issue in deciding to raise or to lower the bank rate,
it follows that the only employment for gold (nevertheless
important) is as a store of value to be held
as a war-chest against emergencies and as a means
of rapidly correcting the influence of a temporarily
adverse balance of international payments and thus
maintaining a day-to-day stability of the sterling-dollar
exchange. It is desirable, therefore, that the
whole of the reserves should be under the control
of the authority responsible for this, which, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the above proposals, is the Bank of England. The
volume of the paper money, on the other hand, would
be consequential, as it is at present, on the state of
trade and employment, bank-rate policy and Treasury
Bill policy. The governors of the system would be
bank-rate and Treasury Bill policy, the objects of
government would be stability of trade, prices, and
employment, and the volume of paper money would
be a consequence of the first (just—I repeat—as it
is at present) and an instrument of the second, the
precise arithmetical level of which could not and need
not be predicted. Nor would the amount of gold,
which it would be prudent to hold as a reserve against
international emergencies and temporary indebtedness,
bear any logical or calculable relation to the volume
of paper money;—for the two have no close or
necessary connection with one another. Therefore I
make the proposal—which may seem, but should not
be, shocking—of separating entirely the gold reserve
from the note issue. Once this principle is adopted,
the regulations are matters of detail. The gold reserves
of the country should be concentrated in the hands of
the Bank of England, to be used for the purpose of
avoiding short-period fluctuations in the exchange.
The Currency Notes may, just as well as not—since
the Treasury is to draw the profit from them—be
issued by the Treasury, without the latter being
subjected to any formal regulations (which are likely
to be either inoperative or injurious) as to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
volume. Except in form, this régime would not
differ materially from the existing state of affairs.</p>

<p>The reader will observe that I retain for gold an
important rôle in our system. As an ultimate safeguard
and as a reserve for sudden requirements, no
superior medium is yet available. But I urge that
it is possible to get the benefit of the advantages of
gold, without irrevocably binding our legal-tender
money to follow blindly all the vagaries of gold and
future unforeseeable fluctuations in its real purchasing
power.</p>

<h3 id="sec_16">II. <i>The United States.</i></h3>

<p>The above proposals are recommended to Great
Britain and their details have been adapted to her
case. But the principles underlying them remain
just as true across the Atlantic. In the United
States, as in Great Britain, the methods which are
being actually pursued at the present time, half
consciously and half unconsciously, are mainly on the
lines I advocate. In practice the Federal Reserve
Board often ignores the proportion of its gold reserve
to its liabilities and is influenced, in determining its
discount policy, by the object of maintaining stability
in prices, trade, and employment. Out of convention
and conservatism it accepts gold. Out of prudence
and understanding it buries it. Indeed the theory
and investigation of the credit cycle have been taken
up so much more enthusiastically and pushed so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
much further by the economists of the United States
than by those of Great Britain, that it would be
even more difficult for the Federal Reserve Board
than for the Bank of England to ignore such ideas
or to avoid being, half-consciously at least, influenced
by them.</p>

<p>The theory on which the Federal Reserve Board
is supposed to govern its discount policy, by reference
to the influx and efflux of gold and the proportion
of gold to liabilities, is as dead as mutton. It
perished, and perished justly, as soon as the Federal
Reserve Board began to ignore its ratio and to
accept gold without allowing it to exercise its full
influence,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">56</a> merely because an expansion of credit and
prices seemed at that moment undesirable. From
that day gold was demonetised by almost the last
country which still continued to do it lip-service, and
a dollar standard was set up on the pedestal of the
Golden Calf. For the past two years the United
States has <em>pretended</em> to maintain a gold standard.
<em>In fact</em> it has established a dollar standard; and,
instead of ensuring that the value of the dollar shall
conform to that of gold, it makes provision, at great
expense, that the value of gold shall conform to that
of the dollar. This is the way by which a rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
country is able to combine new wisdom with old
prejudice. It can enjoy the latest scientific improvements,
devised in the economic laboratory of Harvard,
whilst leaving Congress to believe that no rash
departure will be permitted from the hard money
consecrated by the wisdom and experience of Dungi,
Darius, Constantine, Lord Liverpool, and Senator
Aldrich.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61" class="fnanchor">56</a> The influx of gold could not be prevented from having <em>some</em> inflationary
effect because its receipt automatically increased the balances of the member
banks. This uncontrollable element cannot be avoided so long as the
United States Mints are compelled to accept gold. But the gold was not
allowed to exercise the multiplied influence which the pre-war system
presumed.</p>

</div>

<p>No doubt it is worth the expense—for those that
can afford it. The cost of the fiction to the United
States is not more than £100,000,000 per annum and
should not average in the long run above £50,000,000
per annum. But there is in all such fictions a certain
instability. When the accumulations of gold heap
up beyond a certain point the suspicions of Congressmen
may be aroused. One cannot be quite certain
that some Senator might not read and understand
this book. Sooner or later the fiction will lose its
value.</p>

<p>Indeed it is desirable that this should be so. The
new methods will work more efficiently and more
economically when they can be pursued consciously,
deliberately, and openly. The economists of Harvard
know more than those of Washington, and it will be
well that in due course their surreptitious victory
should swell into public triumph. At any rate those
who are responsible for establishing the principles of
British currency should not overlook the possibility
that some day soon the Mints of the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
may be closed to the acceptance of gold at a fixed
dollar price.</p>

<p>Closing the Mints to the compulsory acceptance
of gold need not affect the existing obligation of
convertibility;—the liability to encash notes in gold
might still remain. Theoretically this might be
regarded as a blemish on the perfection of the scheme.
But, for the present at least, it is unlikely that such
a provision would compel the United States to
deflate,—which possibility is the only theoretical
objection to it. On the other hand, the retention
of convertibility would remain a safeguard satisfactory
to old-fashioned people; and would reduce to
a minimum the new and controversial legislation
required to effect the change. Many people might
agree to relieve the Mint of the liability to accept
gold which no one wants, who would be dismayed at
any tampering with convertibility. Moreover, in
certain quite possible circumstances, the obligation
of convertibility might really prove to be a safeguard
against inflation brought about by political pressure
contrary to the judgement of the Federal Reserve
Board;—for we have not, as yet, sufficient experience
as to the independence of the Federal Reserve system
against the farmers, for example, or other compact
interests possessing political influence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Hoover and many banking authorities
in England and America, who look to the dispersion
through the world of a reasonable proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
of Washington’s gold, by the natural operation of
trade and investment, as a desirable and probable
development, much misunderstand the situation. At
present the United States is open to accept gold at
a price in terms of goods above its natural value
(above the value it would have, that is to say, if it
were allowed to affect credit and, through credit,
prices in orthodox pre-war fashion); and so long
as this is the case, gold must continue to flow there.
The stream can be stopped (so long as a change in
the gold-value of the dollar is ruled out of the question)
only in one of two ways;—either by a fall in the
value of the dollar or by an increase in the value
of gold in the outside world. The former of these
alternatives, namely the depreciation of the dollar
through inflation in the United States, is that on which
many English authorities have based their hopes. But
it could only come about by a reversal or defeat of the
present policy of the Federal Reserve Board. Moreover,
the volume of redundant gold is now so great,
and the capacity of the rest of the world for its
absorption so much reduced, that the inflation would
need to be prolonged and determined to produce the
required result. Dollar prices would have to rise
very high before America’s impoverished customers,
starving for real goods and having no use for barren
metal, would relieve her of £200,000,000 worth of
gold in preference to taking commodities. The
banking authorities of the United States would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
likely to notice in good time that, if the gold is not
wanted and must be got rid of, it would be much
simpler just to reduce the dollar price of gold. The
only way of selling redundant stocks of anything,
whether gold or copper or wheat, is to abate the
price.</p>

<p>The alternative method, namely the increase in
the value of gold in the outside world, could scarcely
be brought about unless some other country or
countries stepped in to relieve the United States of
the duty of burying unwanted gold. Great Britain,
France, Italy, Holland, Sweden, Argentine, Japan,
and many other countries have fully as much unoccupied
gold as they require for an emergency store.
Nor is there anything to prevent them from buying
gold now if they prefer gold to other things.</p>

<p>The notion, that America can get rid of her gold
by showing a greater readiness to make loans to
foreign countries, is incomplete. This result will only
follow if the loans are inflationary loans, not provided
for by the reduction of expenditure and investment
in other directions. Foreign investments formed out
of real savings will no more denude the United States
of her gold than they denude Great Britain of hers.
But if the United States places a large amount of
dollar purchasing power in the hands of foreigners,
as a pure addition to the purchasing power previously
in the hands of her own nationals, then no doubt
prices will rise and we shall be back on the method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
of depreciating the dollar, just discussed, by a normal
inflationary process. Thus the invitation to the
United States to deal with the problem of her gold
by increasing her foreign investments will not be
effective unless it is intended as an invitation to
inflate.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>I argue, therefore, that the same policy which is
wise for Great Britain is wise for the United States,
namely to aim at the stability of the commodity-value
of the dollar rather than at stability of the gold-value
of the dollar, and to effect the former if necessary
by varying the gold-value of the dollar.</p>

<p>If Great Britain and the United States were both
embarked on this policy and if both were successful,
our secondary desideratum, namely the stability of
the dollar-exchange standard, would follow as a
consequence. I agree with Mr. Hawtrey that the
ideal state of affairs is an intimate co-operation
between the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank
of England, as a result of which stability of prices
and of exchange would be achieved at the same time.
But I suggest that it is wiser and more practical that
this should be allowed to develop out of experience
and mutual advantage, without either side binding
itself to the other. If the Bank of England aims
primarily at the stability of sterling, and the Federal
Reserve Board at the stability of dollars, each
authority letting the other into its confidence so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
as may be, better results will be obtained than if
sterling is unalterably fixed by law in terms of dollars
and the Bank of England is limited to using its
influence on the Federal Reserve Board to keep
dollars steady. A collaboration which is not free on
both sides is likely to lead to dissensions, especially
if the business of keeping dollars steady involves a
heavy expenditure in burying unwanted gold.</p>

<p>We have reached a stage in the evolution of money
when a “managed” currency is inevitable, but we
have not yet reached the point when the management
can be entrusted to a single authority. The best we
can do, therefore, is to have <em>two</em> managed currencies,
sterling and dollars, with as close a collaboration as
possible between the aims and methods of the
managements.</p>

<h3 id="sec_17">III. <i>Other Countries.</i></h3>

<p>What course, in such an event, should other
countries pursue? It is necessary to presume to
begin with that we are dealing with countries which
have not lost control of their currencies. But a stage
can and should be reached before long at which
nearly all countries have regained the control. In
Russia, Poland, and Germany it is only necessary
that the Governments should develop some other
source of revenue than the inflationary or turn-over
tax on the use of money discussed in Chapter II.
In France and Italy it is only necessary that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
franc and the lira should be devaluated at a level at
which the service of the internal debt is within the
capacity of the taxpayer.</p>

<p>Control having been regained, there are probably
no countries, other than Great Britain and the United
States, which would be justified in attempting to set
up an independent standard. Their wisest course
would be to base their currencies either on sterling
or on dollars by means of an exchange standard,
fixing their exchanges in terms of one or the other
(though preserving, perhaps, a discretion to vary in
the event of a serious divergence between sterling and
dollars), and maintaining stability by holding reserves
of gold at home and balances in London and New
York to meet short-period fluctuations, and by using
bank-rate and other methods to regulate the volume
of purchasing power, and thus to maintain stability
of relative price level, over longer periods.</p>

<p>Perhaps the British Empire (apart from Canada)
and the countries of Europe would adopt the sterling
standard; whilst Canada and the other countries of
North and South America would adopt the dollar
standard. But each could choose freely, until, with
the progress of knowledge and understanding, so
perfect a harmony had been established between the
two that the choice was a matter of indifference.</p>

<p class="adtitle">THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES
OF THE PEACE</p>

<p><cite>THE TIMES.</cite>—“Mr. Keynes writes with knowledge; he was himself
one of the chief actors in the Conference, and his book is an important
political event.... He brings great literary ability, a broad view, a clear
grasp of general principles, to bear upon the very complicated matters with
which he is occupied, and in his hands these questions of coal, exchange, and
reparation can be read with pleasure by the non-technical student.”</p>

<p><cite>THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE.</cite>—“Mr. Keynes has produced a
smashing and unanswerable indictment of the economic settlement.”</p>

<p><cite>THE ATHENÆUM.</cite>—“This book is a perfectly well-equipped arsenal
of facts and arguments, to which every one will resort for years to come who
wishes to strike a blow against the forces of prejudice, delusion, and stupidity.
It is not easy to make large numbers of men reasonable by a book, yet there
are no limits to which, without undue extravagance, we may not hope that the
influence of this book may extend.... Never was the case for reasonableness
more powerfully put. It is enforced with extraordinary art. What might
easily have been a difficult treatise, semi-official or academic, proves to be as
fascinating as a good novel.”</p>

<p class="adtitle wsub">A REVISION OF THE TREATY</p>

<p class="center b1 wspace larger">Being a Sequel to<br />
“The Economic Consequences of the Peace.”</p>

<p><cite>THE SPECTATOR.</cite>—“The sequel, like the earlier book, is a brilliant
performance regarded as economic argument and compact analysis, and it also
has the advantage of dealing in sardonic and sometimes pitiless humour.”</p>

<p><cite>THE NATION.</cite>—“We found Mr. Keynes’s second book to be of the
same delightful texture as his first; showing a playfully impressive irony,
alternating with warning seriousness, and the extraordinary power of economic
analysis which has made him the greatest intellectual force in the work of
European restoration.”</p>

<p><cite>THE TIMES.</cite>—“Mr. Keynes has the gift of interesting his readers in
problems that are at once vital and obscure.”</p>

<p><cite>THE NEW STATESMAN.</cite>—“It is, like its predecessor, a pleasure to
read, lucid and concise in its economic arguments, dashing in its political
satires and its judgment of persons.”</p>

<p class="adtitle">A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY</p>

<p><cite>THE TIMES.</cite>—“Mr. Keynes’s book will certainly add to his reputation,
and is, indeed, in our opinion, the best book he has yet written.”</p>

<p><cite>THE NEW STATESMAN.</cite>—“The book will be at once ranked among
the most important contributions to the subject.”</p>

<p><cite>Prof. <span class="smcap">Pigou</span> in the ECONOMIC JOURNAL.</cite>—“The problems which
Mr. Keynes has touched, he has not only illuminated with a marvellous
lucidity of style, but has also substantially advanced.”</p>

<p><cite>THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.</cite>—“Mr. Keynes’s book is undoubtedly
one of first-rate importance, and it is especially valuable on account
of the extension of its subject beyond the bounds of purely mathematical
probability.”</p>

<p><cite>THE SPECTATOR.</cite>—“The book contains a great deal that the general
reader will find both interesting and exhilarating.”</p>

<p class="adtitle">INDIAN CURRENCY AND FINANCE</p>

<p><cite>THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL.</cite>—“The book is, and is likely long
to remain, the standard work on its subject.... While academic students
will be grateful for this acute and informing work, it will be read with as
much interest, and perhaps even greater appreciation, by men of business and
affairs.”</p>

<p><cite>THE SPECTATOR.</cite>—“Mr. Keynes’s careful and disinterested study of
the monetary facts of twenty years, and his methodical marshalling of facts
and figures, will be useful even to those—and they will probably be few—who
are not convinced by his reasoning.”</p>

<p><cite>THE CLARE MARKET REVIEW.</cite>—“By his really masterly treatment
of the Indian currency system, the author has made a very valuable
addition to our economic literature.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
